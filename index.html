          Social media and large corporations have a similar strategy.<br><br>
 
          When you browse social media you feel connected.<br>
          When you gather in buildings of a large corporation you feel connected.<br><br>
 
          There are people everywhere.<br>
          Inside the application.<br>
          Inside the office building.<br><br>

          They win by making you fear the feeling of being alone.<br><br>
          The truth is that’s where the growth happens.<br> 
          Growth won’t happen by viewing profiles of social media influencers or friends.<br>
          Growth won’t happen by reviewing the meeting notes from an all-hands meeting at your company.<br><br>
 
          Growth happens when you’re alone with your thoughts.<br>
          When you feel lonely and you take an action.<br><br>
 
          Social media and big corporations are winning.<br>
          They are convincing us to fear being alone.<br>

		  The Free Quote<br><br>
 
          I love to buy things.<br>
          KG has said many times that I am the spender of the family.<br>
          She’s right.<br><br>
 
          I’ve never been on-the-fence about purchasing a product or service and decided to engage with the company because of a “free quote”.<br><br>
 
          Offering a free quote does not work today.<br>
          It didn’t work yesterday.<br>
          It won’t work tomorrow.<br><br>
 
          Take it off your website.<br>
          Take it off your promotional materials.<br><br>
 
          I’d rather see you charge for quotes.<br>
          That’s very interesting.<br><br>
 
          If I saw that your quotes cost $99 each I’d be intrigued.<br>
          I may not move forward, but at least you’d trigger a reaction.<br><br>
 
          Your free quote button triggers a blank stare.<br>

          I get in ruts all the time.<br><br>
          
          A rut is defined as a pattern of behavior that has become dull and hard to change.<br><br>
 
          I agree with the first part:<br><br>

          "...a pattern of behavior that has become dull"<br>
          I get bored.<br><br>

          My boredom causes periods of depression.<br>
          I compare myself to others.<br>
          I think back on times when I had a spark.<br><br>
 
          I get deeper into the rut.<br><br>
 
          The second part is the key:<br><br>

          "...and hard to change"<br>
          The rut is not hard to change.<br><br>

          I need to get off my butt and serve others.<br>
          I need to serve others where I am gifted.<br>
          Where I excel.<br><br>
 
          Then I feel like I’m donating my time and talent for free.<br>
          That’s true service.<br>
          That’s the rut-breaker.<br>

		  I still remember the laughter in the gymnasium.<br><br>
 
          It was my turn to complete the pull-up assessment in middle school.<br><br>

          I jumped up to the bar.<br>
          I pulled as hard as I could.<br>
          I completed zero pull-ups.<br><br>
 
          The class erupted in laughter.<br><br>
 
          Not just my class.<br>
          There were multiple classes in the gymnasium.<br><br>

          The laughter was loud.<br>
          I was as red as a tomato.<br><br>
 
          Today, to start my workout, I did 30 pull-ups.<br><br>
 
          The pain in middle school was worth the smile at 37.<br><br>

          Feel the laughter.<br>
          Make a change.<br>
          Don't judge yourself for how long it takes to smile.<br><br>

		  Progress Road is a street few live on.<br>
          ...especially on Monday.<br><br>

          It's much easier to start the week with a donut on Monday.<br>
          Donuts are delicious.<br>
          Donuts are sinful.<br>
          Donuts make Monday feel like the weekend.<br><br>

          It is much easier to skip a workout on Monday.<br>
          Workouts are painful.<br>
          Workouts take time.<br>
          Workouts make Monday longer.<br><br>

          Progress Road doesn't have a guaranteed destination.<br>
          Sometimes it only leads to suffering.<br><br>

          But what is the alternative?<br><br>

          Acceptance Road.<br><br>

          Acceptance Road is your inner voice.<br>
          Acceptance Road has no unexpected turns.<br> 
          Acceptance Road is predictable.<br><br>

          Progress Road could lead to new friends.<br> 
          Progress Road could lead to a new job.<br>
          Progress Road could lead nowhere.<br><br>

          You get to drive with your inner voice on Acceptance Road or take Progress Road with a bunch of potholes that leads somewhere over there.<br><br>

          An Ode to Tom Brady<br><br>
 
          The greatest don’t believe in days off.<br><br>
 
          He has famously said:<br>
          “If your gonna compete against me you better be willing to give up your life, because I’ve given up mine.”<br><br>
 
          I believe Elon Musk reads that and nods in agreement.<br>
          I believe few people take work as seriously as Elon and Tom.<br><br>
 
          Could Tom Brady be who he is if he was 5’6” instead of 6’5”?<br>
          Likely not.<br><br>
 
          He didn’t decide that he wanted to give up his life for football in his youth.<br>
          He made that decision later in life.<br><br>
 
          Is there anything you’d be willing to give up your life for?<br>
          Commitment is scary.<br>
          What if we get there and it isn’t what we wanted?<br><br>
 
          I don’t have a firm answer on what I'd be willing to give up my life for.<br>
          The fear of missing out is real.<br>
          I look at my kids and wonder if being the best version of a Dad I can be would apply.<br><br>
 
          Sometimes it can be that simple.<br>

          Banks love to lend money to those that don’t need it.<br><br>
 
          If you have money in the bank they will happily lend you money to take out a mortgage.<br>
          If you’re broke, they won’t lend you money.<br><br>
 
          Their business model works, but I wish it was different.<br><br>
 
          I wish when you opened a company banks lined up to try and help you get off the ground.<br>
          They all say they support their local community.<br>
          It is a false marketing message.<br><br>
 
          You have a marketing message similar to this in your company. Something you say currently that your customers laugh at.<br><br>
 
          One of my friends used to wear a shirt that said, “I Love Realtors”.<br>
          She wore it all the time.<br>
          She absolutely loved Realtors.<br>
          It worked because Realtors knew she wasn’t lying.<br>
          She made money off Realtors too.<br><br>
 
          “That’s why she truly loved Realtors” you’ll say…<br>
          Maybe. Maybe not.<br>
          Maybe she truly loved how they helped people get their slice of The American Dream.<br><br>

          The list of things I don’t like doing is getting longer.<br><br>
 
          When I do things I don’t like to do I feel weak.<br>
          I feel pressure because someone else is good at it.<br><br>

          Two Examples:<br><br>

          I bought the best snowblower I could afford.<br>
          I used it for two years.<br>
          I hated every minute of it.<br><br>

          I invested in the stock market.<br>
          Lost the money.<br>
          Learned nothing.<br><br>

          The list of things I like to do is getting smaller.<br>
          The speed of success is as slow as molasses.<br>
          That's why I like it.<br><br>

          I’m terrible at playing guitar.<br>
          It is something I like doing.<br>
          I’m willing to play each day and improve over time.<br><br>
 
          Find the guitars in your life.<br>
          Get rid of the snowblowers in your life.<br>

          Today is the 100th Daily Musing.<br><br>

          100 thoughts at 6am.<br>
          813 email replies from you.<br>
          0 regrets.<br><br>

          There are a lot of new people here lately.<br>
          Here's how The Daily Musings started and how you can help:<br><br>

          My Dad died in August of 2020.<br>
          He was the person that saved me from the voice inside my head.<br><br>

          The voice that tells you you're not good enough.<br>
          The voice that tells you you'll never do it.<br>
          The voice that you wish you could mute.<br><br>

          My Dad called me Mr. Potential.<br><br>

          He called me that out loud to remind me how silly the voice inside my head sounded.<br>
          He called me that to remind me that there's work to be done.<br><br>

          You can't replace the person you lost.<br>
          That's what makes them special.<br><br>

          My solution was to start a conversation.<br>
          One without guard rails.<br>
          To create a community.<br><br>

          TDM started as a way to save myself from my inner voice.<br>
          TDM has become a collection of discussions to help us with our inner voices.<br>
          TDM has become a collection of discussions on how to take action.<br><br>

          Here's what I need from you:<br>
          Let's continue to grow the community with people you know, like and trust.<br><br>

          Forward this email to one person today.<br>
          Ask them to subscribe and join the conversation with you.<br>
          That action would make my day.<br><br>

          To the next 100!<br>

          There’s a simple way to not envy anyone.<br><br>
 
          Before discussing the tip, let’s look at the definition of envy:<br><br>
 
          Envy is the desire to have an attribute belonging to someone else.<br><br>
 
          Money.<br>
          Clothes.<br>
          Height.<br>
          Muscle.<br>
          Business success.<br>
          Their smile.<br>
          Their athleticism.<br><br>
 
          Envy can be dangerous.<br><br>

          You are focusing on someone else’s qualities and desiring them for your own.<br><br>

          Envy can lead to anger.<br>
          Envy can lead to bad decisions.<br>
          Envy can lead to shortcuts.<br><br>
 
          The way I avoid envy is to look at the entire person. I’d have to switch my entire person to become that person. I’d have to give up everything I had and experienced in order to be that person.<br><br>
 
          No thanks.<br><br>
 
          I’ll take my set of problems over another set of seen, and unseen, problems.<br>
          I know what my problems look like.<br>
          I know how to avoid them.<br><br>
 
          It would be nice to have a certain attribute of many different people, but I’m not willing to give up anything.<br><br>
 
          That gets me through the tough times.<br>

          Should you work for a new company?<br>
          Should you sell your company?<br><br>

          Life-changing decisions...<br>
          What do you do in these moments?<br><br>

          Do you phone a friend?<br>
          Talk with your spouse?<br>
          Make an excel spreadsheet?<br><br>

          Your friend doesn't work in the company.<br>
          Your spouse doesn't work in the company.<br>
          The excel spreadsheet will not help you decide.<br><br>

          What you need is a walk outside.<br><br>

          No music.<br>
          No podcast.<br>
          Just walk.<br><br>
 
          After your walk, grab a notebook and a pen.<br>
          Here's the topic:<br>
          You made the tough decision. It is three years later.<br><br>

          Write about what your life looks like.<br>
          Write about what is not working.<br>
          Write about the future.<br><br>

          If the future looks brighter, go for it.<br>
          If you can't paint a picture, stay where you are.<br>
          Keep it simple.<br><br>

          The only bad decision is when you make no decision.<br>

          Business plans are about as necessary as a business card.<br><br>
 
          Business plans validate your brainstorm.<br>
          To a potential investor.<br>
          To a landlord.<br><br>
 
          They are not a reference tool. Once you start your business you stash away the business plan and get to work. Business plans don’t help you deal with unexpected issues.<br><br>
 
          Business cards validate your employment.<br>
          To a potential client.<br>
          To a referral partner.<br><br>
 
          They are not a sales tool. Once you get good at prospecting and networking you stash away the business cards and get to work. Business cards don’t help you win deals or be remembered.<br><br>
 
          My business plan is in my closet.<br>
          It is beautifully written.<br>
          Read by a total of five people.<br><br>

          My business cards are in my closet.<br>
          They look lovely.<br>
          Each business card I gave out was likely thrown out at some point.<br><br>
 
          Write the business plan.<br>
          Design the business card.<br>
          They matter when you get started.<br><br>
  
          The customer matters more than the plan or the cards.<br>

				I ask for KG’s opinion all the time.<br><br>

She sees the problem differently than I do.<br>
She loves to spend time on the why.<br>
I’m stuck on the how.<br><br>
 
We dive deeper into the why.<br>
We figure out the solution and I execute.<br><br>
 
I didn’t solicit KG’s opinion on The Daily Musings.<br>
I didn’t solicit KG’s opinion on opening G&N Insurance.<br><br>
 
We discussed why I would do it.<br>
We discussed how I would get it done.<br>
We discussed the consequences of failure.<br><br>
 
I didn’t ask for permission.<br>
I needed her feedback on the how.<br>
If I asked for permission she’d know I was wasting her time.<br><br>

Should I?<br>
Shouldn't I?<br>
Don't waste other people's time.<br>
Call your own bluff.<br>

				I’ve already written TDM 144<br><br>
 
I’m about 40 days ahead, always.<br>
It is my own way of avoiding failure.<br>
If I had to write The Daily Musing for tomorrow I’d feel pressure.<br><br>

I think I’d get it done. But…<br><br>
 
What is there was a snowstorm and the kids wanted to play?<br>
What if the Celtics were on late last night?<br>
What if I forgot?<br><br>
 
Writers block is the potential failure of TDM.<br><br>

I’m avoiding writers block by constantly writing.<br>
I don’t wait for motivation.<br>
My notes app is full with ideas to write about.<br><br>
 
Here's a method you can copy to avoid your version of failure in business or with your idea:<br><br>
 
Think about how you could be put out of business.<br>
Is there an action you could take to avoid the threat?<br>
If there is, do it.<br>
If there isn't, it isn't a threat. It is a worry.<br><br>

Simplicity wins.<br>

				Kids put life into perspective.<br><br>
 
You don’t have time to focus on too many things when you have kids. You need to pick and choose your hobbies wisely.<br><br>
 
Pre-kids I was into everything.<br><br>
 
Poker? Sure! Let's get a weekly game going!<br>
Basketball? Celtics games, pickup leagues, anything!<br>
Travel? I’ll bring my laptop, tell me where we’re going.<br><br>
 
Now, I consider myself a farmer.<br><br>

I have a few crops that I’m putting a ton of water on each day.<br>
I’m not looking for the harvest tomorrow.<br>
I’m only thinking about the investment of time.<br><br>
 
Fatherhood.<br>
KG.<br>
Health.<br>
Reading.<br>
Writing.<br>
Golf.<br>
Marketing.<br><br>
 
If it doesn’t fit in those categories it is unlikely I’m going to put water on the crops.<br>
It is a very simple “no” when you look at hobbies as an investment of time.<br><br>
 
The opposite of this theory is saying “yes” to everything.<br>
There is a time and a place for that in your life.<br><br>

For now, Mason is singing at the top of his lungs at 9pm.<br>
Time to go make an investment.<br><br>

Happy Pizza Friday,<br>

				Marc Randolph is the co-founder of Netflix.<br><br>
 
Netflix reported over 200M paid subscribers in 2020.<br>
Marc is still upset for not starting Netflix as a subscription service in 1997.<br><br>

He said he wasted time.<br>
He said he didn't trust his gut.<br>
He knew Netflix should be a subscription service.<br><br>

They were a small company that mailed CDs in 1997.<br>
That small company sent Blockbuster to bankruptcy.<br>

				In my 20s I got frustrated often.<br><br>
 
When I look back to understand why it typically relates to a central theme:<br><br>
 
<b>Width vs. Depth</b><br><br>
 
I was spread so thin.<br>
I tried to know everything about anything.<br><br>
 
Boston sports teams.<br>
The financial market.<br>
Real estate.<br>
My business.<br>
Your business.<br>
Whatever you were interested in.<br><br>
 
I got involved in the conversation with 1% of the information.<br>
I made opinions with 1% of the knowledge.<br>
I made bets with 1% of your opinion.<br><br>
 
Now, I try to get deep with my knowledge on very few topics.<br><br>

Entrepreneurship.<br>
Marketing.<br>
Sales/Networking<br>
Golf.<br>
Celtics.<br>
Health.<br>
Dad Life<br>
Family Life<br>
…I’ll chime in.<br><br>

I’ve earned the right to be at the table for those topics.<br>
Otherwise, I’ll clap from the sidelines.<br><br>

I’m no longer competing on knowledge consumption.<br>
My 20s was filled with competition, in all ways.<br>
My 30s has been filled with depth, not width.<br>

				Skiing and Entrepreneurship Part 1<br><br>
 
I take a few deep breaths at the top of the mountain.<br>
I look at my surroundings and admire nature.<br>
I’ve mapped out the trails I want to ski.<br><br>

But now that I’m here…<br><br>

I could care less about the plan.<br>
The trail other there looks exciting!<br><br>

We change our course.<br>
The other skiers agree. <br>
We take off down the mountain.<br><br>
 
I’m an average skier.<br>
I don’t care if I’m the fastest down the mountain.<br>
I’m here to enjoy it.<br>
I may not be on a mountain again this year.<br><br>

Entrepreneurship is the same journey.<br><br>
 
We admire the view from the top.<br>
We look at other local businesses.<br>
We analyze the landscape of business.<br><br>
 
We create a business plan.<br>
It feels aggressive.<br>
The goals feel larger than life.<br><br>

Then we look at the path ahead and don’t care about what we wrote.<br>
We're going to react to the customer, to the market.<br>
We're going to pivot wherever we feel like pivoting.<br><br>
 
We make sure our partners and employees are in agreement.<br><br>
 
We don’t mind ups and downs. They happen.<br>
We're not trying to be the fastest millionaire.<br><br>
We may never open another business again.<br>
We're here to enjoy it.<br><br>
 
Sometimes we only focus on how fast we're going.<br>
That’s how accidents happen in skiing and in business.<br>

				It's fun to ski alone.<br>
It's better to ski with friends.<br><br>

You laugh about the wipe outs.<br>
You exaggerate the jumps.<br>
You discuss the next trail to tackle together.<br><br>

You laugh at the past.<br>
You learn from the past.<br>
You discuss the future.<br><br>
 
In entrepreneurship, recalibration is a necessary occurrence.<br><br>
 
You need to make sure everyone understands the path ahead.<br>
What to expect down the road.<br>
Why you're on the journey together.<br><br>
 
Getting down the mountain the fastest is not the goal of skiing.<br>
Getting to the finish line the fastest is not the goal of business.<br><br>
 
Pull over.<br>
Align your team.<br>

Laugh..<br><br>
 
It makes the journey worth it.<br><br>
 
If you commit to skiing, you’re committing to hanging out after.<br>
If you commit to entrepreneurship, you’re committing to celebrating a days work.<br><br>
 
If you’re not laughing, you’re on the wrong mountain.<br>
If you're not laughing, you're in the wrong business.<br><br>

Life is hard.<br>
You get one chance.<br><br>

You don't have to enjoy each day at work.<br>
You don't have to work at a place you don't enjoy.<br><br>

				At night, I take off my shirt next to the laundry machine.<br><br>

There's always blood near the part that covers my elbows.<br>
I apply the laundry detergent to the shirt.<br>
I toss it in the machine and hope the stain washes away.<br><br>

This is a regular occurrence.<br>
It sucks.<br>
I have psoriasis.<br><br>

On days when I feel frustrated or stressed I see more blood.<br>
It is a painful reminder that life is hard.<br><br>
 
I should wear bandages.<br>
I don’t want to explain my “condition” to other people that see the band-aids. <br><br>
 
This morning Mason handed me a band-aid.<br>
It was a loud green color.<br>
It was… The Hulk.<br><br>
 
He said, “Here Dad, you're bleeding again.”<br>
 
I put the band-aid on my elbow.<br>
Mason smiled and said, “You feel better, right?”<br><br>
 
That’s what I say to our kids after I put band-aids on them.<br><br>
 
The funny thing is…<br>
I did feel better.<br><br>

Screw it.<br>
I have The Hulk band-aids on my elbows.<br>
It’s better than blood on my shirts.<br><br>
 
Kids have a way of simplifying your life.<br>

				How you treat your vendor relationships could determine your success.<br><br>
 
Think about the last conference you attended.<br>
Where were the vendors?<br><br>
 
Sometimes they are in a room that says: “Vendor Hall”.<br>
The room may as well have a “Do Not Disturb” sign on it.<br>
No one is going in there.<br><br>
 
Sometimes they are in the food area.<br>
This might be worse than the “Vendor Hall”.<br>
The food area is a grab and go.<br>
There is very limited time to eat before the next activity.<br><br>
 
The solution?<br><br>

The speakers and the person running the conference need to grab the mic and tell the attendees that they have two options:<br><br>
 
Pay twice the amount to attend the conference next year.<br>
Or, be generous with their time and go meet the vendors.<br><br>
 
Seek out the vendors at the next conference.<br>
They are the reason the conference is affordable.<br>

Being a celebrity comes with desirable things:<br><br>
 
Wealth.<br>
Heroism.<br>
Intellect.<br><br>
 
All of those attributes would be amazing, but have you ever been in a grocery without being recognized by anyone? It’s awesome. No one was able to judge me when I bought plant based jerky today and I loved it.<br><br>
 
Fame in a niche is intriguing.<br>

Admire: To regard with respect or warm approval.<br>
Love: A feeling of deep affection.<br><br>
 
When I’ve admired a quality of others, I typically do not obtain the quality.<br>
I admire it for a reason.<br>
It feels a little unattainable.<br><br>
 
I admire patient parents.<br>
I have moments of patience.<br>
KG and our kids would not describe me as patient.<br><br>
 
The quality does not come naturally to me.<br><br>
 
When I’ve loved a quality of others, I typically obtain the quality.<br>
I love it for a reason.<br>
I want it to be mine too.<br><br>
 
I loved passionate entrepreneurs.<br>
It didn’t look easy to me.<br>

				We all learn differently.<br>
Coaching should be uniform.<br><br>
 
Coaching requires two parties that are committed to excellence.<br>
The coach.<br>
The student.<br><br>
 
That’s it.<br><br>
 
Everything else is secondary.<br>
There are thousands of ways to coach.<br>
There are thousands of ways to learn.<br><br>
 
If the coach or the student is not committed, the relationship fails.<br>
It is the job of the coach to evaluate the relationship.<br><br>
 
We hired a business coach at G&N for three years.<br>
We were committed to his system.<br>
When we started to get bored, he told us we “graduated”.<br><br>
 
That was his fancy way of firing us.<br><br>
 
We lost the commitment.<br>
He decided to end the relationship.<br><br>
 
I gained respect for him.<br><br>
 
We should learn how to fire clients and friends.<br>
If we lose commitment to the client, it’s time to move on.<br>
If we lose commitment to the friend, it’s time to move on.<br><br>
 
The client and the friend will be OK.<br>
The best part…<br>
The client and the friend will thrive.<br><br>
 
So will we.<br>

Attention is a finite resource.<br>

So, we tell them that we’re better.<br>

It became generous when it became for you.<br><br>

I started emailing my thoughts.<br>
I realized that we're going through the same journey.<br>
The conversations that occur each day blow my mind.<br><br>

If you’re trying to grow an audience, remember this:<br>
No one is asking for you right now.<br><br>

They don't know they need you.<br>
They want to feel better about themselves.<br>
They don't want to feel better about you.<br>

				People tell me I’m disciplined.<br>
Personality tests indicate I'm an achiever.<br>
A maximizer.<br><br>

My retainer disagrees.<br>

I know I need to wear it.<br>
Still...<br>
I find an excuse.<br><br>
 
It’ll give me a headache.<br>
I forgot to clean it.<br>
I'll do it tomorrow.<br><br>

There are retainers in your life.<br>
Screw them.<br>
Focus on the things that matter.<br><br>

My kids know I'm an achiever.<br>
My wife knows I'm an achiever.<br>
My colleagues know I'm a maximizer.<br><br>

My retainer may be important someday.<br>
For now, it's just a piece of plastic.<br>

				I tried to give KG a little time off yesterday.<br><br>

I tried my best.<br>
In the morning, I was racing around the house doing chores.<br><br>

Dishes.<br>
Kids breakfast.<br>
Cleaning.<br>
Dump run.<br>
Grocery shopping.<br><br>

Then, it was time for soccer with Mason.<br>
Pick up lunch for the family.<br><br>

Then, it was time for baseball with Mason.<br>
Emma came.<br>
Bonus points for alone time for Mom.<br><br>

We got home.<br>
It was 3pm.<br><br>

KG looked refreshed.<br>
She said,<br>
"Take some time to yourself. The kids and I will go next door to Jenn's."<br><br>

I don't need that!<br>
I'm good!<br>
I could do this all day!<br><br>

But...<br>
All I could say was, "Sure!"<br>

She left with the kids.<br>
I collapsed into my office chair.<br><br>

I was exhausted.<br>
I hadn't showered.<br>
I didn't even know if I drank a glass of water all day.<br><br>

It was only 3:15pm on a Saturday.<br><br>

KG can do this any day of the week and look good doing it.<br>
This is normal for her.<br><br>

I looked like a lost puppy.<br>
And I didn't even have to finish the afternoon.<br><br>

To all of the Moms in The Daily Musings community...<br>
Enjoy your day.<br><br>

To KG...<br>
You have a beautiful way of seeing the world.<br>
May the next year be full of travel, laughter and youth sports.<br><br>

Happy Mother's Day,<br>

				15 months ago I asked KG if I should cancel.<br><br>

I’d been traveling a ton.<br>
I was exhausted.<br>
I needed a break.<br><br>

I had two options:<br>
Fly home.<br>
Fly to Florida.<br><br>

The flight from California to Boston would give me a few extra days with her and the kids.<br>
The flight from California to Florida would give me a chance to see my Dad for a few days.<br><br>

She told me to go for it.<br>
I wouldn’t regret the time with him.<br>
I agreed.<br><br>

I went to see my Dad.<br><br>

We golfed.<br>
We laughed.<br>
We talked about the future.<br><br>

Six months later he died.<br><br>

Monday is filled with emails.<br>
Monday is filled with meetings that should be emails.<br>
Monday can wait.<br><br>

Who should you call?<br>
What if you didn’t have as much time to call them as you planned?<br><br>

Time is finite.<br>
This is your reminder.<br>

				There are two ways to live your life.<br><br>
 
The First Way:<br>
You believe that you are immortal.<br>
Maybe not literally.<br>
…but, you certainly are acting like you’re immortal.<br><br>
 
The Second Way:<br>
You believe that tomorrow isn't guaranteed.<br>
Today may not be perfect.<br>
…but it may be your last day.<br><br>
 
Make the phone call to someone you miss.<br>
Catch up.<br><br>
 
Shoot hoops with your daughter.<br>
Be present.<br><br>
 
What’s the alternative?<br>
Go to sleep and hope tomorrow comes?<br><br>
 
I don’t actually believe I’ll die today.<br>
That’s a weird way to live.<br>
I do believe tomorrow is not promised.<br><br>
 
That’s the only way I’ll live.<br>

I ate her food years ago.<br>
I thought it sucked.<br><br>
 
What changed?<br><br>

She didn’t stop cooking.<br>
She didn’t stop trying.<br>
She had to make hundreds of mediocre meals to get to where she is now.<br><br>
 
She’s not a professional chef.<br>
She doesn’t have more time than you and I.<br>

				I debated shaving my beard yesterday.<br><br>
 
I’ve had it for almost four years.<br>
I grew the beard in New Hampshire during a vacation.<br>
It was a joke.<br>
I kept it for a week when I got back to Massachusetts.<br><br>
 
188 weeks later…<br>
still there.<br><br>
 
This morning I wanted a change.<br>
I thought about shaving my head.<br>
Then my beard.<br><br>
 
I walked out of the bathroom and saw my son Mason.<br><br>
 
“Mase, do you think Dad should shave his beard?”<br><br>
 
He looked at me.<br>
He touched my beard.<br>
Then he said:<br><br>
 
“No way. I like your beard.”<br><br>

I love looking at the Moon.<br>
I'll watch any documentary about astronauts or the Universe.<br><br>
 
Yesterday I asked our kids if they thought there were planets we didn’t know about.<br>
If there was life elsewhere.<br>
If there were stars we couldn’t see.<br><br>
 
“Dad… How could we know everything?”<br><br>
 
I had no reply.<br>
That’s exactly right.<br>
Mason answered a question that has been buzzing around in my head for decades.<br><br>

I never had an answer.<br>
At five, he already has the correct answer.<br><br>

I ask a question.<br>

I interrupt their thinking and rephrase the question.<br>
I rephrase the question to try and help them.<br>

				If you forgot to brush your teeth this morning I wouldn’t know.<br>
Most people wouldn’t know.<br><br>
 
If you forgot to brush your teeth for a few days I wouldn’t know.<br>
Most people wouldn’t know.<br><br>
 
Yet, we always brush our teeth.<br>
I’ve laid in bed without brushing my teeth.<br>
It feels strange.<br>
Uncomfortable.<br>
I can’t imagine sleeping without brushing my teeth.<br><br>
 
This is a habit I will not break.<br><br>
 
Why are other habits so easy to break?<br><br>
 
Imagine going on an exercise streak like brushing your teeth?<br>
Imagine going on a reading streak like brushing your teeth?<br>
Imagine doing anything twice a day that improved your health, your mind or your spirit?<br><br>
 
Better question for you and I…<br>
What’s stopping us?<br><br>
 
Brushing our teeth is not more important.<br>
You can replace those.<br>
Replacing your brain is harder.<br>
Replacing your health is harder.<br>
Being miserable is harder.<br><br>
 
Time for a streak.<br>
Bring the toothbrush to another area of your life.<br>

Be the first.<br>
Be the only one.<br>
Be the best one.<br><br>
 
Being the first is possible.<br>
We were the first insurance agency to make bobbleheads of their referral partners.<br>
It worked.<br>
It was a unicorn idea.<br>
Excellent execution.<br>
Still a unicorn.<br><br>
 
Being the only one is finite.<br>
If you’re idea is good enough, someone will copy it.<br>
That will create jealousy.<br>
How will you handle the competition that copies you?<br>
The only one is the most dangerous.<br><br>
 
The best one is my choice.<br>
It is in my control.<br>
Not the entire product.<br>
A sliver.<br>
A small benefit.<br>
A benefit that starts as a snowball and transforms into an avalanche.<br><br>
 
I will always try to be the absolute best at one part of the process.<br>
I’ll let others try and be the first or the only one.<br>
I hope they win.<br>
If they do, it’s another idea that I can analyze.<br>
It’s another idea with a small benefit.<br>
It’s a small benefit that I can try to be the best at.<br><br>

Go Monday.<br>
Be the best at something today,<br>

"Mason...<br>
See those houses and cars we're driving by?<br>
Daddy insures them!"<br><br>
 
"What does insure mean, Daddy?"<br><br>
 
This is happening each day in your business.<br>
Your consumer does not understand.<br>
You are speaking a foreign language.<br><br>
 
To explain insurance, I used his LEGOs as an example.<br><br>
 
"If your LEGOs were damaged in a fire, Daddy's company replaces them with new LEGOs!"<br><br>
 
Mason now thinks G&N Insurance is a place where heroes work.<br>
People who get kids replacement toys are heroes.<br><br>

I've changed my diet.<br><br>

KG snapped me back to reality.<br>
“Zack… he’s growing.<br>

He’s not kidding…”<br><br>

Mason is a five year old.<br>
He has growing pains.<br>
It makes sense in reverse.<br><br>

That's obvious to KG.<br>
That's obvious to you.<br><br>

I could only see Mason making fun a weakness of mine.<br>
I couldn't see past my own insecurities.<br><br>

You are assuming people are making fun of them.<br><br>

				I can still hear my Dad say it today.<br>
“That’s a mitzvah my young grasshopppaahh”<br><br>
 
A mitzvah is a good deed.<br>
But, it’s a little deeper.<br><br>
 
A mitzvah is an act of kindness.<br>
A conscious act of empathy.<br>
But, it’s a little deeper.<br><br>
 
It’s doing something without an expectation of return.<br>
It’s doing something for a deeper connection with yourself.<br>
With others.<br>
And if you believe, with God.<br><br>
 
KG and I were doing a mitzvah for a friend the other night.<br>
I got out of the car to put the gift in his mailbox.<br>
The second I opened the car door I heard the sound.<br>
It sounded almost like a lawnmower.<br><br>
 
KG knew it right away:<br>
“Zack…the grasshoppers.<br>
It’s your Dad.”<br><br>

Tears.<br>
Laughter.<br><br>

A sign I needed.<br><br>

Maybe mitzvahs are my connection to him.<br><br>

Do a mitzvah for someone in the next seven days.<br>
Send me an email and let me know how you feel.<br>
It would make my Dad proud.<br>

I remember where we were when we decided that we should have kids.<br>
Kiawah Island, South Carolina.<br>
September, 2014.<br><br>
 
I didn’t understand the gravity of that decision.<br>
It was a decision we made and never considered an alternative.<br><br>
 
Last night Mason told me he loved me more than basketball.<br><br>
 
Some decisions you cannot analyze with a spreadsheet.<br>
You have to hope.<br>
You have to believe.<br><br>
 
The bigger the decision, the more you need to trust how you feel.<br>
Your gut.<br>
What you believe will occur.<br><br>
 
I didn’t know what it would cost to have a child.<br>
I didn’t know Kiawah Island would be our last vacation together without kids.<br><br>

Trust yourself.<br>
You make good decisions.<br>

Kyle is my personal trainer.<br>
He sets the routine.<br><br>

My job is to record the results.<br>
We review the path forward each week.<br><br>
 
If he asks me to do 6 reps and I get 5 done, I record 5.<br>
I won't record a fake number.<br>

The handicap system set by the USGA is simple:<br>
Record your scores.<br>
Their math sets your handicap.<br><br>
 
If you record fake numbers, you have a fake handicap.<br>
You’re not fooling anyone.<br>
The person you’re playing with knows.<br><br>
 
You can’t fool your friends.<br><br>
 
The numbers don’t tell your story.<br>
You don’t have to be special.<br>
Just be you.<br>

It takes time.<br>

				Mason invited his class to go miniature golfing last week.<br><br>
 
We were celebrating his birthday.<br>
We were meeting his classmates for the first time.<br>
We were meeting the parents.<br>
It was the first birthday party in a long time.<br><br>
 
It was 92 degrees outside when we arrived.<br>
There was no shade.<br>
We were sweating immediately.<br><br>
 
We laughed…<br>
This would happen.<br>
Give us a break COVID!<br><br>
 
20 minutes later clouds rolled in.<br>
Thunder clouds.<br>
This would happen.<br>
Of course it’ll rain on his birthday.<br><br>
 
No rain.<br>
No thunder.<br>
Just a break from the heat.<br><br>
 
Our prayers were answered.<br>
We were saved from the heat.<br>
The kids had a blast.<br><br>
 
Yet, in the moment, I was pissed.<br>
I was mad at the world for “ruining” his day.<br><br>
 
The “ruin” never came.<br>
I was mad for nothing.<br><br>

I used to think it was a noun.<br><br>
 
Balance is defined as mental steadiness.<br>
Balance is defined as equilibrium.<br><br>
 
Sounds like a noun.<br>
In practice, it’s a verb.<br><br>

You can practice until balance looks easy.<br>
It will never be easy.<br><br>

Work-life balance is neither a noun nor a verb.<br><br>

Some years work is heavier.<br>
Some years life is heavier.<br><br>

We’ve talked about motivation a lot.<br>
Your social media is filled with people that focus on motivation.<br><br>

Motivation is a simple.<br><br>
 
The motivation you already have inside you is stronger than the motivation someone else is trying to help you discover.<br><br>
 
They can’t tell you how great it feels to take off your shirt at the beach.<br>
You’ve already made up your mind to keep your shirt on.<br>
Your motivation is to find better shirts to wear.<br><br>
 
Screw it then.<br>
Move on.<br><br>
 
Find another area of your life where you are strong.<br>
Get some small wins.<br>
Come back to the beach another day or another year.<br>
Or not at all.<br><br>

Here’s a mistake I’ve made countless times:<br>
Being a “yes-man” to a big prospect.<br><br>
 
The VIP client.<br>
The CEO at a big company.<br><br>
 
I’ve done it.<br>
I’ve regretted it each time.<br><br>
 
It’s not because I thought G&N wasn’t the best fit for them.<br>
We were.<br>
We continue to be.<br><br>
 
I’ve over-promised to get the client.<br>
I’ve said we’ve done things that we don’t do.<br><br>
 
“Do you specialize in…”<br>
Sure!<br><br>
 
“Have you ever helped…”<br>
Sure!<br><br>
 
When I got back in my car I didn’t celebrate.<br>
I didn’t blast loud music and jam back to the office.<br><br>
 
A pit in my stomach formed.<br>
I had to go tell the team I promised something I know we cannot do.<br><br>
 
They had to research a new product.<br>
They had to invent a new process.<br>
They had to perform a miracle.<br><br>
 
I’ve rented that client for a few years.<br>
Eventually they find another company that can do it better.<br><br>
 
Yesterday we insured the CEO of a Fortune 200 Company.<br>
I had nothing to do with it.<br><br>

It took me 11 years to stop making the mistake.<br><br>

Will you stop before it's too late?<br>

				Fake it until you make it is a strategy that can work.<br><br>
 
Fake it until you make it is about you.<br><br>
 
I told prospective referral partners we had a Boston Office in 2010.<br>
We didn’t.<br>
Any coffee shop in Boston was my office.<br><br>
 
I told prospective clients we offered a registry service at the RMV.<br>
We didn’t.<br>
I was the service. I was free.<br><br>
 
That’s faking it until you make it.<br>
I didn’t hurt anyone by faking it.<br><br>
 
Fake it and let the team deal with it is different.<br><br>
 
A CEO asked me if I insured apartments in France.<br>
I told him, “Yes. Many times.”<br>
Then I drove back to the office and told the team we had to figure it out.<br><br>
 
I made zero friends at my office that day.<br>
I lost trust that day.<br>
I rented a client and used my team.<br><br>
 
Fake it till you make it works.<br>

				Mason’s favorite vacation was our Dude Trip to Florida.<br><br>

Here's what you and I would say about the trip:<br><br>
 
Accommodations sucked.<br>
Pool was closed.<br>
Tons of turbulence on the flight down.<br>
Three hour delay in the airport before the flight home.<br>
Food was average.<br><br>
 
We went down to see my Dad.<br>
To check out his new apartment.<br>
To spend some time together as "dudes".<br><br>

My Dad didn't have sheets for our bed.<br>
My Dad couldn't access the pool.<br>
The flights back and forth were a nightmare.<br><br>

It. Was. Awesome.<br><br>
 
Every week, he asks me to do it again.<br>
He begs me to go down to my Dad's place.<br>
He knows my Dad is dead.<br>
He told me my Dad would want us to do it again.<br><br>

				In 2017 I walked into Life Time Fitness determined to get into shape.<br><br>

I went to the gym four days a week.<br>
A few months went by.<br>
I wasn’t in-shape.<br><br>

I decided it was time to start looking like an idiot in public.<br>
I hired a personal trainer.<br><br>
 
I was embarrassed.<br>
I was admitting to the world I needed help.<br>
Paying for a gym membership wasn’t good enough for me.<br>
I needed a coach to show me how to do it.<br><br>
 
Most people in the gym looked like they knew what they were doing.<br>
I was paying a trainer because I couldn't figure it out.<br>
I was the idiot.<br><br>
 
Fast forward three years…<br><br>
 
We built a gym at home.<br>
Working out has become important to KG and I.<br>
Kyle, the trainer I hired over three years ago, is still training us.<br><br>
 
I’ve built my life around being in-shape.<br>
I’m executing.<br>
I'm not there yet, but I'm close.<br><br>

Give me three more years.<br>

KG, here’s a card.<br>
Someone else wrote a message about how it feels to have a wife.<br>
I wrote “I love you” at the end and signed my name.<br>

I’ve always bought the blank card and wrote a message.<br>

Yes.<br>
It is.<br><br>

The bill is more than we expected.<br>
The project is moving slower than we expected.<br><br>

Our timing isn’t perfect.<br>
I wish we built the house two years ago.<br><br>

The lumber and delays are ROI discussions.<br>
ROI is focused on a return that is judged monetarily.<br><br>

What if your return has nothing to do with money?<br>
Most of us do nothing in fear of being judged for doing something.<br><br>

The cost of doing nothing is larger than the lumber bill.<br>

I believe in vision boards.	<br><br>
 
I’ve had them since I was a kid.<br>
I’m in the process of making a new one.<br><br>
 
Vision boards are personal.<br>
They are not meant to be shared.<br><br>
 
They are kept in a private place.<br>
Alone with your thoughts.<br><br>
 
You won’t achieve greatness by designing a vision board.<br><br>

Money won’t find you.<br>
Winning won’t knock on your door.<br><br>
 
Staring at expensive things doesn’t make you a millionaire.<br>
Wanting success won’t do it either.<br><br>

				My Dad told us he wanted to die alone.<br><br>
 
He didn’t want us at his bedside.<br>
He didn’t envision a peaceful death.<br>
It was his wish.<br><br>
 
It was 9pm on August 7th, 2020.<br>
I was exhausted.<br>
I had been with him all day.<br><br>
 
The morning started with small sentences.<br>
Night brought a turn for the worse.<br>
He hadn’t spoke in hours.<br>
He made a loud gurgles. That was it.<br><br>

The nurses told me it was the death rattle.<br>
They told me his hearing would be the last thing to go.<br>
"They can hear until the very end..."<br><br>
 
I remembered his wish.<br>

I lied down next to him.<br>
I won’t dive into everything that was said.<br>
That’s between him and I.<br>
 
At the end I held his face and said to him:<br>
“I am leaving you now.<br>
 I’m going home to my family.<br>
That's where you want me to go.”<br><br>
 
He lurched up.<br>
He grabbed my cheek.<br>
He muttered words that I’ll never forget.<br><br>
 
His nurse looked at me on my way out of his room and said:<br>
“I just witnessed a miracle.”<br><br>

I did too.<br><br>
 
He left us a few hours later.<br><br>
 
Death can be beautiful.<br>
It depends how you look at it.<br>

				In 2015 my Dad visited for Father’s Day.<br><br>
 
Mason was three weeks old.<br>
It was the first meeting between my Dad and Mason.<br>
On Father’s Day.<br><br>
 
What a beautiful coincidence.<br>
I was pumped.<br>
Three generations.<br><br>
 
My Dad’s health was declining.<br>
We knew these moments were some of his last.<br><br>
 
We brewed extra coffee.<br>
My Dad loved a whole pot of coffee for himself.<br>
We picked out a special outfit for Mason.<br><br>
 
We brought Mason downstairs and let my Dad hold him.<br>
We cried.<br>
We took pictures.<br><br>
 
KG said “Happy Father’s Day guys!”<br>
My Dad looked at her and said thank you.<br>
He said it was a special day for him.<br><br>
 
I told him it was a special day for me too…<br><br>
 
He. Looked. Stunned.<br><br>
 
“Holy shit. You’re a faaathaaa!”<br><br>
 
I can still hear his booming laughter.<br><br>
 
This will be one of my hardest and best days of the year.<br>
I miss my Dad each day.<br>
The Musings keeps his spirit alive for me.<br>
Thanks for being part of my healing process.<br><br>
 
To all the Dads out there…<br>
Enjoy the day.<br><br>

I get stressed at the beginning of a vacation.<br><br>
 
Is the alarm set?<br>
Will we get to the airport in time?<br>
Did we pack everything?<br><br>
 
The ride to the airport is cringe-worthy for KG.<br><br>
 
I barely talk to her.<br>
I ignore the kids.<br>
My mind is in a thousand places.<br><br>
 
I hate flying.<br><br>
 
That’s the cause of all of my anxiety.<br>
I’m worrying about everything to take spotlight off the thing I’m truly worried about.<br><br>
 
Flying.<br><br>
 
That shows up everywhere.<br>
When I’m frustrated, I’m ignoring the true cause of my frustration.<br>

				My parents went to all of my games.<br><br>
 
Except one.<br>
It was snowing.<br>
A lot.<br><br>
 
Our indoor soccer game was not cancelled.<br>
My parents told me we couldn't go, so I found a ride with my friend Chris.<br><br>
 
I remember I had three goals.<br>
A hat-trick.<br>
In the first half.<br><br>
 
My parents are never coming again I thought…<br><br>
 
Then I took a shot off my hand.<br>
I looked down.<br>
My wrist was dangling off my arm.<br><br>
 
I didn’t feel pain.<br>
Just shock.<br><br>
 
I went to the bench and sat there until we finished the game.<br>
It was broken.<br>
No question.<br><br>
 
They finished the game.<br>
Chris’ Dad drove us home.<br>
We got to the bottom of my steep driveway and it wasn’t plowed.<br>
There was over a foot of snow.<br><br>
 
Toby and Chris helped me walk up the driveway.<br>
Each step made me nervous…<br><br>
 
What am I going to tell my parents?<br>
They are going to be pissed.<br><br>
 
The door opened.<br>
My Dad took one look at me and said:<br><br>
 
Are you f****** kidding me?! We gotta go to the hospital?!<br><br>
 
Chris and Toby still bring it up to this day.<br>
My Dad’s reaction was priceless.<br>
We laughed.<br>
He did not.<br>

				Breaking my right wrist had severe consequences.<br><br>
 
I missed an entire season of basketball.<br><br>
 
I cried.<br>
Not because of the pain.<br>
Because I couldn’t practice.<br><br>
 
I called Coach Dooley and asked if I could come to practice.<br>
He told me I couldn’t.<br>
I was devastated.<br><br>
 
The next day he gave me a call and told me he had an idea.<br>
Practice my left hand.<br>
Be the best with my left hand.<br><br>
 
Develop a weapon is what he said.<br><br>
 
The next eight weeks I did everything with my left hand.<br>
Non-stop.<br>
The problem became an opportunity.<br><br>
 
Next time your internet goes down.<br>
Next time you can’t drive to work.<br>
Next time an event gets cancelled.<br><br>
 
Develop a weapon.<br><br>
 
Make calls.<br>
Write hand-written notes.<br><br>
 
You don’t need to look at negative moments as “opportunities”.<br>
No one wants to hear that.<br><br>

				Some of my Dad’s last words of advice are still haunting me.<br><br>
 
He told me not to take things too seriously.<br><br>
 
It’s taken me months to understand what he meant.<br>
When he said it I fluffed him off.<br><br>
 
Don’t take life too seriously.<br>
Just don’t care?<br><br>
 
We had a Member/Member golf tournament at Framingham Country Club last week.<br>
I played terribly.<br>
I was pissed.<br><br>
 
That night I sat in my office and looked at YouTube.<br>
I studied golf swings for a lengthy amount of time.<br>
I looked back and thought about all the errant shots.<br><br>

The missed putts.<br>
The bad decisions.<br><br>
 
I’m better than that.<br><br>
 
Then I looked to my left and saw a picture of my Dad’s hand holding my hand at his hospital bed on his last day.<br><br>
 
Stop taking life so seriously.<br>
I’m breaking down golf swings on YouTube like I have any idea what went wrong.<br><br>
 
If he was here he’d be laughing at me.<br>
He’d say this:<br><br>
 
It’s a golf tournament.<br>
There will be another one.<br>
Go play with your kids.<br><br>
 
He’s right.<br>

I’ve done it for a few years.<br>
It’s hard.<br>
It’s annoying.<br><br>
 
I can’t do something else while brushing.<br>
I can’t check my phone.<br>
I can’t walk around the house.<br><br>
 
I need to look in the mirror to get it done.<br>
It requires focus.<br>
It wakes me up.<br><br>

The imperfections.<br>

We decided to get a second Wheaten Terrier.<br><br>
 
It’s a big decision.<br>
There’s a lot of reasons why we shouldn’t do it right now.<br><br>
 
We are building a house.<br>
The kids are in and out of camps all Summer.<br>
We want to travel and see our friends and family.<br><br>
 
Here’s how we analyzed the decision:<br><br>
 
What’s the worst outcome?<br>
The dog and Kenzie/Mason/Emma don’t get along.<br>
We have to give the dog to another family.<br><br>
 
What’s the best outcome?<br>
The dog is part of our family while we send Emma and Mason off to college.<br>
The dog grows up with all of us and transforms our family.<br><br>
 
The best outcome is “better” than the worst outcome is “bad”.<br>
It’s a simple way to evaluate a decision.<br><br>

There are hundreds of reasons it isn’t a good decision in the short term.<br><br>

Our house is going to be ripped apart.<br>
We can’t go away on the 4th of July.<br>
We’re going to need to buy new furniture.<br><br>
 
Whatever.<br>
The best outcome outweighs the worst outcome.<br><br>

I’ve finished dead last many times.<br><br>
 
I remember coming in last place in the pull-up contest in 7th grade.<br>
I came home and cried.<br>
I had plenty of excuses.<br>
None mattered.<br>
I came in last.<br><br>
 
My Dad laughed at me.<br>
“I couldn’t do one today if I had to” he said.<br><br>
 
Great.<br>
My 300lb Dad can’t do a pull-up.<br>
That’s helpful to compare.<br><br>
 
I left angrier.<br>
His words didn’t help.<br>
The truth is nothing would help.<br><br>

				COVID hit Massachusetts businesses hard.<br><br>
 
Many were forced to close for good.<br>
Not all states were the same.<br><br>
 
That debate is for another time.<br><br>
 
If your business is filled with people right now, consider it a blessing.<br>
COVID was a reminder that there are forces outside of your control that can close your doors.<br><br>
 
Yesterday I went to a liquor store to grab a gift for a friend.<br>
I overheard an employee say, loudly:<br>
“I hate people. They are the worst.”<br><br>
 
Unfortunately for him, I was walking towards him because I had a question.<br><br>
 
He turned bright red.<br>
He apologized and said he didn’t realize there was a customer nearby.<br><br>
 
He’s upset he got caught complaining about his customer.<br>
He’s not upset at his thoughts.<br>
He thinks they are true.<br><br>

Don’t be that guy.<br><br>

Customers aren't always right.<br>
Customers aren't always guaranteed either.<br><br>

He’s the CEO of a company with over 2,500 employees.<br>

When I have a meeting with someone of that caliber, I try to as a question about their journey.<br>

I stop reading more books than I finish reading.<br><br>
 
After the first two chapters I know if the book is worth finishing or not.<br><br>
 
Reading is meant to be enjoyable.<br>
If the book starts slow, it likely ends even worse.<br><br>
 
If I don’t like the first few bites of a dish, I don’t eat the entire meal.<br>
If I don’t enjoy a conversation with someone, I’m unlikely to follow up and chat again.<br><br>
 
Read what you enjoy.<br>
Do what you enjoy.<br><br>

				Do you have a go-to question?<br><br>
 
Something you can ask anyone?<br>
Something to carry the conversation forward?<br><br>
 
If not, here is one for you:<br><br>
 
What’s something that always has to be in your fridge?<br>
What’s the food item that has to be there?<br><br>
 
I’ve asked hundreds of people this question.<br>
I love the replies.<br>
One of my favorites was, “lasagna”.<br><br>
 
I asked her why.<br>
Turns out she eats lasagna every day.<br>
She wasn’t kidding.<br>
We had a fifteen minute conversation about lasagna.<br>
I loved it.<br><br>
 
Find a go-to question.<br>
A question you care about.<br>
A question you want to hear the answer to.<br><br>
 
So…<br>
What’s the food item that has to be in your fridge?<br><br>

Go Monday,<br>

Kenzie is getting older.<br><br>
 
She’s 10 years old.<br>
Wheaten Terriers generally live between 12-15 years.<br>
We know she’s in her last few chapters.<br><br>
 
We want to spend more time with her, but..<br>
We also have kids that are six and four years old.<br>
We also have typical “we’re busy” excuses.<br><br>
 
I want to read more.<br><br>
 
I know it is a key to my success.<br>
When I read, I create.<br>
When I read, I lead.<br><br>
 
I know I want to spend more time reading, but..<br>
I also have kids that are six and four years old.<br>
I also have typical “I’m busy” excuses.<br><br>
 
Both of these problems got solved at the same time by accident.<br><br>
 
I decided to start the day outside instead of inside.<br>
It helps me wake up.<br>
It’s better than coffee.<br><br>
 
I get up, put on my shoes, and go outside.<br><br>
 
AirPods.<br>
Dog leash.<br>
Watch the sunrise and walk.<br><br>
 
Nature has a way of solving your problems.<br>

				Mason was born at a strange time.<br><br>
 
He was born shortly after I made one of the biggest business mistakes of my career.<br><br>
 
I made an incorrect calculation.<br>
It sounds minor.<br>
It turned out to be major.<br><br>
 
We made assumptions based on the calculation.<br>
We expected to have a lot more revenue.<br>
We hired based on the additional revenue expected.<br><br>
 
Within months we had maxed out of our line of credit.<br>
We had no money to pay ourselves and our staff.<br><br>
 
And then Mason was born.<br>
And I had to make a decision days later.<br><br>
 
We could find investors.<br>
-This would allow us to continue to take a salary each month.<br><br>

Or, we could go without a salary.<br>
-This would allow us to retain complete ownership of the business.<br><br>
 
Both options came with the same additional step:<br>
We had to let go of three employees.<br><br>
 
The decision was not difficult.<br>
We chose to go without a salary until we could increase our revenue.<br>
We also chose to give a severance package to the people we removed from our team.<br><br>
 
Everyone tells you when your first child enters the world it is the most beautiful time of your life.<br>
It is beautiful.<br>
But the rest of your life continues.<br>
The rest of your life doesn’t stop so you can enjoy the moment.<br><br>
 
Whenever I think it isn’t the right time to do something…<br>
Such as buy a house.<br>
Such as stop drinking for a quarter.<br>
Such as change my diet.<br><br>
 
I think back to those days.<br>
Holding Mason.<br>
Crying by myself in a room with him wondering what to do.<br><br>
 
We went without a salary for four months.<br>
Those were not the most beautiful days of my life.<br>
Those days helped me make better decisions for difficult moments in my life.<br><br>
 
The perfect time doesn’t exist.<br>
It never will.<br>
There’s just time.<br>

				My favorite picture of my Dad is a picture of him pissed off.<br><br>
 
It sits next to me while I work.<br>
He looks furious… because he was.<br><br>
 
The year was 2000.<br>
Our family was visiting Jackie at James Madison University.<br>
We just finished the 11-hour-drive.<br><br>
 
It was time to eat.<br>
We went to Outback.<br>
We were famished.<br>
We ordered everything on the menu.<br><br>
 
It was time to leave and we played our typical game…<br>
If we guess the total bill within .50, Dad would give us cash equal to the bill.<br><br>
 
This time was different.<br>
I knew the bill was coming soon.<br>
I left to go to the bathroom.<br>
Found the waiter.<br>
I told him my Dad wanted me to look over the bill quickly before it came.<br><br>
 
I cheated.<br><br>
 
The bill came to the table.<br>
I “guessed” within twenty cents.<br>
When my Dad looked up, my family snapped the picture.<br><br>

My Dad is pissed.<br>
I’m laughing.<br>
It’s the perfect picture.<br><br>
 
After many obscenities from my Dad, I told him the truth and gave him back the cash.<br><br>
 
The picture is worth more than the cash.<br>

				There’s so much I want to do.<br>
It overwhelms me at times.<br><br>

When I read a story with Mason, I’m thinking about what I’m going to do after.<br>
When I’m brushing Emma’s hair before bed, I’m thinking about the notes in my Evernote app.<br><br>
 
We discussed balance before.<br>
It’s a verb.<br>
We are always trying to achieve balance.<br>
Once we think we are in-balance, we stop paying attention.<br>
Then we fall.<br><br>

I feel the same way about being present.<br><br>
 
Being present means being fully conscious of the moment.<br>
Being free from the noise of internal dialogue.<br><br>
 
Being present isn’t about being perfect.<br>
It’s about knowing when you are not present.<br>
It’s about knowing how to respond when you’re not.<br><br>
 
I try to be mindful of the future.<br>
As long as it doesn’t sacrifice the present moment.<br><br>
 
When it does, I need to remove myself from the future.<br>
The future can wait.<br><br>

Happy Pizza Friday.<br>
Be present with your pie.<br>

				It’s always busy season.<br><br>
 
In 2019, I was on a flight almost every week.<br><br>

It came with many positives.<br>
I saw parts of the country I’ve never seen before.<br>
I met some amazing leaders and teams.<br><br>
 
I assumed things would calm down and I’d have family time later.<br><br>
 
That time was never on the way.<br>
It was given to me when the world slowed to a halt.<br>
I got lucky.<br><br>
 
During COVID I got to see the impact travel had on my family.<br>
On me.<br>
On my goals.<br><br>
 
Without time to analyze how my work was impacting my personal goals I’d be on a plane again today.<br>
COVID game me time to stop and think.<br>
COVID stopped my busy season.<br><br>
 
Now, work "interrupts" my personal goals and time with my family.<br><br>

COVID gave me a chance to shuffle the deck of cards.<br>
I got to deal the hand I want, based on the order I desire.<br>

My friend Bradley and I were discussing the difference between faking it and making it today.<br><br>
 
Faking it looks fun.<br>
Faking it looks glamorous.<br>
Faking it gets you access to places you’ve never been.<br><br>

I've faked it.<br>
I've posted the photo of getting to work at 5am.<br><br>

I was at work at 5am.<br>
I wasn't happy about it.<br>
I faked that I was.<br>
I said it was part of the hustle.<br><br>

It wasn't.<br><br>

I was there because we made a mistake and I had to clean it up.<br>
That isn't hustle.<br>
That's disaster avoidance.<br><br>
 
Making it is different.<br>
It can be boring.<br>
It can be exhausting.<br><br>

Making it isn't post-worthy.<br>
You won't see it on Instagram.<br>
You can't find it on a Story.<br>
You can see it in your friends eyes.<br>
When they are lit up at the end of the day.<br>
When their foot is tapping while they are telling a story.<br><br>

They are in the process of making.<br><br>

Do not disturb them.<br>
Encourage them.<br><br>
 
Everyone knows you when you’re faking it.<br>
Most people don’t know you when you’re making it.<br>
…but you do.<br><br>
 
You can spot the faker.<br>
You can’t spot the maker.<br><br>
 
They’re too busy.<br><br>

Go Monday,<br>

January 21st, 2016 was our first Bobblehead Bonanza.<br><br>

The goal of the Bobblehead Bonanza was to create an event for all of our referral partners to attend and network with each other.<br><br>

We invited everyone.<br>
Realtors.<br>
Mortgage Originators.<br>
Closing Attorneys.<br>
Financial Advisors.<br><br>
 
Everyone got a custom bobblehead of themselves as a party favor.<br><br>
 
We sold out the Liberty Hotel in Boston on the 4th floor.<br>
Over 300 guests.<br><br>
 
I was pumped.<br>
The room was packed.<br>
Energy was high.<br><br>

So many people I admired in one room.<br>
I had over a hundred conversations to start.<br><br>
 
I was chatting with one of our guests, Ali, when he started snapping his fingers in my face.<br><br>
 
“Zack… Zack… You’re Not Here!!”<br>
I looked at him puzzled.<br>
He continued.<br><br>

“You’re physically here.<br>
Mentally.. you’re gone.<br>
What’s the matter with you?<br>
Either be here, or don’t be here.”<br><br>
 
He was right.<br>
He caught me trying to have a conversation while mapping out the next person I’d talk to in the room.<br><br>
 
I apologized.<br>
But I didn't need to.<br>
Ali gave me a life lesson.<br><br>
 
Each year I remind Ali that I remember his words.<br><br>
 
If you see me at an event, I’m talking to the person I’m with.<br>
I’m not looking for the next conversation.<br>

An employee quit today.<br>
She’s been with us since 2012.<br><br>
 
It hurt.<br><br>
 
We sat in my office to chat about her decision.<br>
It’s the right decision for her.<br>
She found a company that is offering a role we don’t have.<br><br>
 
After she left I thought about our conversation.<br>
I thought about her career at G&N.<br><br>
 
When she joined G&N she was going through a divorce.<br>
She was a bank teller with no insurance experience.<br>
She just wanted a chance.<br><br>
 
Fast forward eight years…<br>
She’s happily married.<br>
She has two beautiful children.<br>
She is a homeowner.<br>
And now she’s on a path to make more money than she could possibly dream of eight years ago.<br><br>
 
We did our job as a company.<br>
She did her job as a leader at our company.<br>
Mission accomplished.<br><br>
 
My own lens complicates simple situations.<br>
She’s in a better place than she was when she joined us.<br>
We’re in a better place than we were when she joined us.<br><br>
 
It worked for both of us.<br>

I don’t want to look at the numbers.<br><br>
 
I know there are pieces that aren’t working.<br>
The Daily Musings could be better.<br>
The subscriber count could be larger.<br><br>
 
Maybe I should start a podcast.<br>
Maybe a Facebook Group.<br>
Maybe this. Maybe that.<br><br>
 
So, I look at the numbers.<br><br>
 
I run the report that shows the subscribers that have not opened any of the last five emails.<br><br>
 
Shit.<br>
That’s a lot of people.<br><br>
 
Maybe I should email them and tell them I’m removing them to save their Inbox.<br>
Maybe I should ask them how I could create a better conversation for them.<br><br>
 
Ugh.<br>
It all feels weak.<br><br>
 
Then I look at the numbers again….<br><br>
 
I wonder how many people have opened every single email in June.<br>
93% of the subscribers have opened every single one.<br><br>
 
What the heck am I doing caring about the 7%?<br><br>
 
It happens in business.<br>
It happens with your friends.<br>
It happens at home.<br><br>
 
Today I was insecure enough to hold 7% of people’s opinion of me higher than my own opinion of myself.<br><br>
 
You’ll do it at sometime today too.<br><br>
 
This is your reminder.<br>
Focus on the 93% in your life.<br>
Leave the other 7% of people alone.<br><br>
 
They want to be alone anyways.<br>

				My Dad loved a free meal.<br><br>
 
His order was always the same…<br><br>
 
Multiple appetizers. ( buffalo wings)<br>
Simple entrée.<br>
Lots of waters.<br><br>
 
He rarely ordered anything expensive.<br>
But when he wasn’t paying he had a bigger smile.<br>
There was something about a free meal that brought out the best version of my Dad.<br><br>
 
He always said the same thing when the bill came:<br>
“Just let me leave the tip, OK?”<br><br>
 
We never did.<br>
A free meal is a free meal.<br><br>
 
He’d ask again.<br>
In a different way.<br><br>
 
“What was the total?”<br>
 
He’d try to slip us cash at the end.<br>
We never took it.<br><br>
 
He loved a free meal until it became time to pay.<br>
Then he felt bad.<br><br>
 
Sometimes I look back with regret.<br>
I should’ve let him pay the tip.<br>
It's what he wanted to do.<br><br>

Then again...<br>
He didn't want me to take the cash.<br>
He raised me to show him it was my pleasure.<br><br>

Happy Pizza Friday.<br>
Leave a good tip for the staff.<br>

“Give this to the nurse please…”<br>
He handed me $200.<br><br>
 
“What is this for, Dad?”<br><br>
 
He took a deep breath and said:<br>
“I haven’t tipped the nurse in a long-time.”<br><br>
 
It was August 6th.<br>
Two days before his death.<br><br>

I was in his room at the assisted living facility.<br>
He was in good spirits.<br>
He looked happy.<br>
…but the nurses had told me this would be the week.<br><br>
 
I slipped the $200 into his dresser on the way out.<br>
It didn’t feel right to give them that much money.<br>
My Dad has lost it… <br><br>
 
The next morning the $200 was in his hands.<br>
“Zack. I wasn’t kidding.<br>
Give it to them.”<br><br>
 
The guy was stubborn.<br>
I gave his nurse, Janesa, the $200.<br>
She cried and told me stories of her homeland in Nigeria.<br><br>
 
“This $200...<br>
This has the ability to change everything for my family.<br>
I will send it to them.<br>
Your father is a great man.”<br><br>
 
I looked over.<br>
My Dad hadn’t moved for hours.<br>
But I could see a faint smile on his face.<br><br>
 
He knew he won.<br>
He got me good.<br><br>

I thought it was his last mitzvah...<br>
I was wrong.<br><br>

There’s a framed picture of a donkey on the wall in our living room.<br><br>
 
It’s large.<br>
It’s perfect.<br><br>
 
Someday we will move to a different place.<br>
We’ll put our house on the market.<br>

It is not for sale.<br>
It is a conversation starter.<br><br>
 
If you were a fly on the wall at our house you’d hear the word donkey at least 17 times today.<br>

				A year ago I was told a familiar phrase:<br>
“I'm sorry, that’s not possible.”<br><br>

We were in the middle of COVID.<br>
Lots of us were scared.<br>
Schools were closed.<br>
…everything was closed.<br><br>
 
My Dad was not allowed to leave his assisted living facility.<br><br>
 
He health had declined.<br>
He had a few last wishes.<br>
One of them was to see our new place in Westport.<br><br>
 
He wanted to eat lobster bisque and look at the water.<br>
He wanted to eat a lobster roll and watch the kids play.<br><br>
 
I called Christie, the director of facility.<br>
I begged.<br>
I pleaded my case.<br><br>
 
It didn’t matter.<br>
“We need to follow the policy.”<br><br>
 
I thought of the movie Tommy Boy.<br>
The scene where Tommy is trying to convince the waitress.<br>
He tried to make her laugh.<br>
He tried to make her smile.<br>
He didn’t try to convince her.<br><br>
 
I gave it a shot…<br><br>

“Christie, you leave me no choice...<br>
I’m going to have to bring the lobster bisque and the lobster roll to the facility. Your other residents are going to be jealous. But, I gotta do what I gotta do. Is there a time most of them are taking a nap so they don’t see the lobster? It'll probably smell like the sea. I don't want them to be confused."<br><br>
 
She laughed.<br>
She paused.<br>
She laughed some more.<br><br>
 
“Zack. Take your Dad tomorrow.”<br><br>

The next day was one of the most memorable days of my life.<br><br>
 
We drove down with the windows open.<br>
Bob Seger blaring.<br>
We ate lobster.<br>
The kids ran in the yard.<br>
I got a photo with my Dad that I’ll treasure forever.<br><br>
 
On the way home my Dad and I talked about the future.<br>
My future without him.<br>
We had one of our last lengthy conversations.<br><br>

He then told me it was one of the best days of his life.<br><br>
 
Nothing is impossible.<br>
Go for it.<br>

				My Dad loved to chat with waitresses.<br><br>

He thought he related to them.<br>
He thought he was one of them.<br><br>

I witnessed the typical small talk at a restaurant in Florida.<br><br>

A little politics.<br>
A little woe-is-me.<br>
A little damn-the-man.<br><br>

She laughed.<br>
I rolled my eyes.<br><br>

She took his order of buffalo wings and water.<br>
She smiled the entire time.<br>
Her eyes never left his.<br><br>

“We’re cut from the same cloth, Zack.”<br><br>
 
I looked at the waitress.<br>
She was missing a few teeth.<br>
Her clothes looked disheveled.<br>
She looked exhausted.<br><br>
 
I looked at my Dad.<br>
He provided for a family of five.<br>
He was a small business owner.<br>
He was living in Florida.<br><br>
 
“Dad…”<br><br>
 
I started to reply.<br>
Then I paused.<br><br>
 
I took another look at my Dad.<br><br>
 
What if I didn’t know his history?<br>
What if I didn’t know his journey?<br><br>
 
His teeth were a wreck.<br>
His hair was unkept.<br>
His shirt read: “Quit yer bitchin!” across the front.<br><br>
 
My Dad wasn’t dressed for his past.<br>
He was dressed for where he was today.<br>
He trying to fit in where he thought he belonged.<br><br>
 
Ultimately...<br>
that's what we all want.<br>
He had it figured out.<br><br>

I was the one that was lost.<br>

Kenzie loves the snow.<br><br>
 
She races out the door to stroll around the yard.<br>
She makes a large circle around our backyard.<br>
She comes inside covered in snow.<br><br>
 
This repeats over and over.<br>
She rarely goes through the middle of our yard.<br>
She retraces her footsteps and goes along the same path.<br><br>
 
Emma & Mason love the snow.<br><br>
 
They race out the door to play in the yard.<br>
No area is left untouched.<br>
They come inside covered in snow.<br><br>
 
This repeats over and over.<br><br>
 
Kids want to make their mark.<br>
They want to be where they haven't been.<br>
They don't want to retrace their footsteps.<br><br>

I don't want Emma and Mason to walk in the path I made.<br>
It's predictable.<br><br>

I want them to find the snow in their lives that hasn't been touched.<br>

				Mason wanted for a basketball hoop for Christmas.<br><br>
 
“Pay for the setup service.<br>
There’s no way I’m building that thing…”<br><br>
 
That’s all I cared about.<br><br>
 
KG found the perfect hoop.<br>
The setup fee was $100.<br>
Money well-spent from my perspective.<br><br>
 
The hoop came.<br>
The setup service kept getting pushed back.<br>
We were upset.<br>
We took it out of the box and tried to build it together.<br><br>
 
No way.<br>
Too heavy.<br>
Too many parts.<br>
I gave up quickly.<br><br>
 
The setup was confirmed for January 1st, 2021.<br>
New Years Day.<br><br>
 
I was sure they’d cancel again.<br><br>
 
At 7am, on New Years Day, a man showed up by himself to build the hoop.<br>
It was 22 degrees outside.<br>
I asked him if another person was coming.<br>
He said the guy called out sick.<br><br>
 
I felt horrible.<br><br>
 
At 9am I checked on the handyman to see how he was doing.<br>
He wasn’t making too much progress.<br>
I decided to help him and build it together.<br><br>
 
For the next five hours we built the hoop in the freezing cold weather.<br>
We built it incorrectly four times and had to take it apart and rebuild it each time.<br><br>
 
That’s not what I remember most.<br>
What I remember most was him telling me about where he was from.<br>
Nigeria.<br>
A war-torn part of Nigeria.<br>
His wife and kids were still there.<br>
He was working hard to help them get to America.<br>
He was sending money each month to try and help them get here.<br><br>
 
He was grateful.<br><br>
 
He told me that he made $25 of the $100 we paid for the setup service.<br>
The company kept $75.<br><br>
 
He drove from Dorchester to Southborough (40 minutes) on New Years Day in 22 degree weather to build a basketball hoop for seven hours for $25.<br><br>
 
We shared a soda water in the driveway before he left.<br>
He chatted about Nigeria.<br>
The battles and the crimes.<br>
And why he still wants to go back.<br><br>

He's a college graduate.<br>
Working in 22 degree weather.<br>
For $25.<br><br>
 
I tipped him $100.<br>
He cried.<br><br>
 
The basketball hoop in our yard is my constant reminder.<br>
We have it good.<br>
Spread the good.<br>

				I drink black coffee.<br><br>
 
It’s a habit that was forced on me.<br><br>
 
I had my Bar Mitzvah at age 13.<br>
It’s a big deal in the Jewish religion.<br>
It’s the ceremony of a Jewish boy that becomes a Jewish man.<br>
The Jewish boy is ready to observe the religion and be eligible to take part in the religion.<br><br>
 
The morning before my Bar Mitzvah my Dad told me to come with him to Dunkin Donuts.<br><br>
 
On the ride over we talked about the importance of a Bar Mitzvah.<br>
He spoke about his and how proud his father was of him.<br><br>
 
We got to Dunkin Donuts and he told me it was time for me to have my first coffee.<br>
For him, coffee was a big deal.<br>
He had a pot of coffee, at least, each morning.<br><br>
 
This was the sign of becoming a man.<br>
Bar Mitzvah is for Jews. Which we are.<br>
Coffee is for Goulds.<br><br>
 
I was excited.<br>
I walked up to the cashier and said:<br><br>
 
“I’ll have a coffee please!”<br><br>
 
She smiled and replied: “How do you take it? Want cream or sugar?”<br><br>
 
I had no idea what cream in coffee tasted like, but it sounded like ice cream and who doesn’t like sugar?<br><br>
 
“Yes! Cream and sug…”<br><br>
 
The smack on the back of my head made everyone look.<br>
My Dad glared at me like I had just committed a sin.<br>
…and to him, I had.<br><br>
 
I didn’t cry, but I remember being completely silent.<br>
My Dad had never hit me before.<br><br>
 
“He’ll have it black. Just like I will.”<br><br>
 
The cashier erupted in laughter.<br>
My Dad laughed.<br>
I didn’t laugh. My head stung. And the coffee tasted awful.<br><br>
 
It’s been 24 years since that moment.<br>
I can still hear the smack on the back of my head.<br><br>
 
I’m laughing now, and drinking black coffee.<br>

				My Dad dreamed about retiring in Arizona.<br><br>
 
Warm climate.<br>
Great golf courses.<br>
Casinos nearby.<br><br>
 
Life would be good.<br>
We lived in Massachusetts.<br>
The weather wasn't great.<br><br>
 
But…<br>
He belonged to a top-notch golf club.<br>
He had access to casinos, and visited them frequently.<br><br>

He had two of the three retirements "wants".<br>
Retirement didn't sound too different.<br>
Just a change of scenery.<br><br>

Maybe that's why it never came.<br>
He never got to retire.<br>
He got the warm climate when he moved to Florida.<br>
But he kept working.<br><br>
 
We make grand plans for life down the road, but....<br>
Our body is likely in the best shape it ever will be today.<br>
Our mind is likely in the best shape it ever will be today.<br><br>
 
Happiness should be now.<br>
What if we’re waiting for something that will never come?<br>

Tim Ferriss has over 500 podcast episodes.<br>
He's an excellent interviewer.<br><br>

I rarely listen to his podcasts without a notebook.<br>
It isn't for the guests.<br>
It's for him.<br><br>

He asks great questions.<br>
Questions I steal.<br><br>

In his books and podcasts he asks a similar question in various ways:<br>
What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love?<br><br>

The fridge question is my go-to, this is a close second.<br>
I ask it frequently.<br><br>

I have a lot of absurd things I love.<br>
I have a lot of unusual habits.<br><br>

One of my habits sticks out.<br><br>

I walk backwards down the stairs in the morning.<br>
I believe it makes the steps just a little bit quieter.<br>
It keeps the kiddos in bed for a few minutes longer.<br><br>

As I write this Musing, I feel a little ridiculous.<br>
But...<br>
I'll still walk backwards tomorrow.<br><br>

What's your unusual habit?<br>
What's your absurd thing you love?<br><br>

Go Monday,<br>

				38 years old.<br><br>
 
That’s how old Michael Collins, Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong were when they landed on the Moon.<br><br>
 
They got to the Moon with technology that dwarfs in comparison to the iPhone on my desk.<br>
At 38.<br><br>
 
They reached the absolute height of their careers.<br>
At 38.<br><br>
 
They couldn’t go any further.<br>
Literally.<br>
At 38.<br><br>
 
Imagine being 38 and being the greatest.<br>
Imagine being 38 and not being able to do anything greater than you already did.<br><br>
 
It’s no surprise they had personal issues.<br>

They are human.<br><br>
 
They may have peaked professionally before they peaked personally.<br><br>
 
When you can’t go any further professionally, what do you do?<br>

My Dad and Kenzie got off to a rocky start.<br><br>
 
We got Kenzie when she was 7.5 weeks old.<br>
She was a tiny puppy.<br>
Under 8lbs.<br><br>
 
We were in love.<br><br>
 
My Dad was in town and decided to visit.<br>
He loved dogs.<br>
He wanted one for himself, but he was convinced he couldn’t take care of the dog.<br><br>
 
My Dad gave his big toothy smile when he saw Kenzie for the first time.<br>
He played with her.<br>
Then she gave us “the look”.<br><br>
 
It was time to go potty.<br>
Fast.<br><br>

We dashed outside of our apartment in Brookline.<br>
Sprinted down the stairs.<br>
...then I heard a yelp.<br><br>
 
I looked back and saw my Dad’s face.<br>
He looked horrified.<br>
He had stepped on Kenzie.<br><br>
 
Not a light step.<br>
A step you make when you weigh 300lbs.<br><br>
 
Kenzie was dragging her leg.<br>
She wouldn’t put pressure on it.<br>
She was crying.<br><br>

My mind went into a dark place.<br>
I thought my Dad broke Kenzie's leg.<br><br>
 
I was distraught.<br>
I didn’t know what to do.<br><br>
 
Then.<br>
Kenzie started walking.<br>
Then running.<br>
She was fine.<br><br>
 
From that moment on, my Dad and Kenzie were inseparable.<br>
When he came to visit, she never left his side.<br>
My Dad didn’t move often.<br>
Kenzie loved that about him.<br><br>
 
They were a match made in heaven.<br>
A place where there are no stairs.<br>

                My friend and I went to the Travelers golf tournament in Connecticut in 2017.<br><br>

We followed Jordan Spieth most of the round.<br>
Everyone was rooting for him.<br>
He was 24.<br>
He was on top of the world.<br><br>

He finished on Sunday tied with Daniel Berger.<br>
They went to a sudden death playoff on hole 18.<br>
Jordan holed a shot from the bunker to win in dramatic fashion.<br><br>
 
The crowd went crazy.<br><br>
 
My friend and I went back to the hotel after and decided to share a pint of Guinness to celebrate an excellent day.<br><br>
 
On the walk into the bar someone bumped into us.<br>
We looked to our right and it was Jordan Spieth.<br>
He apologized and kept walking inside the bar.<br><br>
 
We paused.<br>
“That’s Jordan…”<br><br>
 
There was no one else in the hotel lobby bar.<br><br>
 
Jordan sat in a chair by himself watching SportsCenter.<br><br>
 
Naturally, we sat right next to him.<br>
We were those guys that sat next to someone at a bar with a hundred seats open.<br>
We didn’t care.<br><br>
 
For the next 30 minutes we chatted with Jordan.<br>
He bought us beers.<br>
His caddy Michael Greller came down and joined us.<br><br>
 
As he was leaving he bought us another round and wished us well.<br><br>
 
I saw him 60 minutes after he just won $1,224,000.<br>
I saw him 60 minutes after thousands of people told him he was awesome.<br><br>
 
He didn't just buy us a few beers.<br>
He shared the beers with us.<br>
For a moment in time, he felt like just another guy at the bar.<br><br>
 
I hope all of us would buy a few pints of Guinness if we won $1,224,000.<br>
Buying a pint of Guinness is different than sharing a pint of Guinness.<br>
That's why people like Jordan are special.<br><br>

There are people that admire you.<br>
Share a moment with them.<br><br>

They can buy what they want.<br>
They can't buy time with you.<br>

				I don’t need help at our local grocery store.<br><br>
 
I know where everything is.<br>
The isles are clearly marked.<br>
The store is well-lit.<br>
The experience is boring.<br><br>
 
It’s meant to be.<br><br>
 
It’s like my first job at Liberty Mutual.<br><br>
 
I knew how to sell the product.<br>
The game of sales was easy if I followed the playbook.<br>
I was selling a product people already knew about: insurance.<br><br>
 
The experience was boring.<br>
It’s meant to be.<br>
It’s a job.<br><br>
 
Entrepreneurship is different.<br><br>
 
Entrepreneurship is like walking into a grocery store in China.<br>
I don’t speak Mandarin.<br>
I don’t know what items I should eat and which I should avoid.<br><br>
 
I could ask for help, but I don’t speak the language.<br><br>
 
So…you adapt.<br>
You trust your gut.<br>
You point the finger at yourself when you’re wrong.<br>
You keep going back to the grocery store until you speak the language.<br><br>
 
Parts of your life should feel like the local grocery store.<br><br>

Make sure some of your life is frustrating.<br>
Like walking into a grocery store in China.<br>
That's where you'll find growth.<br>
Hidden in a language that is foreign to you.<br>
...for now<br><br>

Today I’m taking a walk for my Dad.<br><br>
 
A walk I promised him I’d make.<br><br>
 
Today is the club championship at Framingham Country Club.<br>
It’ll be an emotional day.<br><br>
 
I’m a good golfer.<br>
I’m not good enough to be the club champion.<br>
I’m good enough to qualify for the championship.<br><br>
 
My Dad asked me to play last year, but I wasn’t in the right place to compete.<br>
He had weeks left to live, at most.<br>
It didn’t feel right.<br><br>

I promised him I'd do it in 2021.<br>
I told him he'd have to stick around to see.<br>
We both knew he wouldn't make it.<br><br>

Today, I will confidently walk to the first tee with a smile.<br>
I could care less what I score.<br>
If I’m in last place, it won’t matter.<br><br>
 
He always said the same thing to me before a big moment:<br>
"Stop taking life too seriously."<br><br>
 
I won’t be taking the club championship too seriously.<br>
It’s gonna be a fun walk.<br><br>
 
This one is for you, Dad.<br>

I truly don’t know.<br>
It sounds like a lovely idea.<br>
I didn’t do it.<br>
I have reasons why I didn’t.<br>
Those reasons may have paid off for me.<br>
Those reasons could slow your growth.<br><br>

I remember one of my first conversations with my trainer, Kyle.<br><br>
 
He was excited.<br>
I wasn’t excited.<br>
I was defeated.<br><br>
 
I was admitting I couldn’t lift on my own.<br>
I needed someone to hold my hand.<br><br>
 
It wasn’t a positive experience.<br><br>
 
He asked me what my goals were.<br>
I laughed.<br>
I didn’t know.<br><br>
 
I didn’t have a weight goal.<br>
I wanted to weigh more.<br>
I wanted more muscle.<br>
…but there was no number.<br><br>
 
I didn’t have a bench goal.<br>
I wanted to bench more.<br>
I wanted more gains.<br>
…but there was no number.<br><br>
 
We went back and forth for a bit and I said…<br><br>
 
“I don’t want to miss workouts.”<br><br>
 
That’s kinda it.<br>
I want to enjoy working out.<br>
I want to be someone who works out.<br><br>
 
We laughed again.<br><br>

				We're invincible.<br>
Until we're not.<br><br>

Yesterday was a harsh reminder.<br><br>

We attended the Celebration of Life for a good friend.<br>
Someone we lost at only 38 years old.<br>
Someone that had a laugh that was contagious.<br><br>

Death is a teacher.<br>
But how long will we remember the lessons?<br><br>

The second KG and I got home the kids were all over us.<br>
Dinner.<br>
Break up a fight between them.<br>
Play four games of Trouble.<br>
Showers.<br>
Read them stories.<br><br>

Tomorrow is going to be busy.<br>
So is the next day.<br>
And the next day.<br><br>

The only way to make death a teacher is to keep it close to you.<br>
Not a reminder in your phone.<br>
Not a sticky note that you never look at.<br><br>

We were given a button with a picture of our friend Yac today.<br>
I'm going to put the button on the dashboard of my car.<br>
I'm going to have to remove it before driving.<br><br>

The button will be my lesson from death.<br><br>

I can be late.<br>
The person I'm meeting will forgive me.<br>
The place I'm going to will still be there.<br><br>

There's no reason for me to speed.<br><br>

You can learn a lesson from death.<br>
Or, you can believe you're invincible.<br>

I’ve had a lot of career rounds in golf lately.<br><br>
 
They all end around the 5th hole.<br>
There are two par fives in the first five holes.<br>
There’s a chance I’m one under par. Maybe two.<br>
“If I keep this up, I’ll shoot a 66.”<br><br>
 
Then I bogey six.<br>
Then I double seven.<br>
Then I’m thinking about grabbing a few beers at the turn instead of posting my career low round.<br><br>
 
This happens in golf frequently.<br>
In the rest of my life it is non-existent.<br><br>
 
When Mason was born I didn’t envision him to be a basketball star.<br>
When Emma took her first steps I didn’t picture her as the President of The United States.<br><br>
 
That unnecessary pressure on them.<br>
They need to be good humans.<br>
The rest doesn’t matter.<br><br>
 
That’s how I need to approach golf.<br>
I need to enjoy the walk.<br>
The score is the score.<br>
That isn’t the purpose.<br><br>

That's how I need to approach business.<br>
That's how I need to approach parenting.<br>
That's how I need to approach life.<br><br>

Enjoy the walk.<br>

				I turned around and saw Bob Kraft.<br><br>
 
He was by himself at STRIP by Strega.<br>
It was a few months after the Patriots Super Bowl win in 2017.<br><br>
 
I was with a group of 24 entrepreneurs at a meetup event hosted by our business coach, Nate.<br>
Everyone started talking about “Mr. Kraft”.<br>
“Can you believe he’s right there?!”<br><br>
 
I got up and walked over to him and asked if I could sit down.<br>
I told him I was a huge fan of the work he was doing at the Kraft organization and with the Patriots.<br>
He thanked me and asked me how he could help me.<br><br>
 
That was his first question.<br>
Offering to help a random person.<br><br>
 
I’m not writing this Musing to tell you Bob Kraft is the best human being.<br>
He’s not.<br>
He’s flawed.<br>
We all are.<br><br>
 
He asked some questions about my work.<br>
He offered to take a few pictures with me.<br>
Then he went back to his meal.<br><br>
 
He was by himself.<br>
Eating a steak.<br>
If he wanted to be alone there are other places he could have gone.<br><br>
 
Introduce yourself.<br>
Embrace the awkward moments of life.<br>

				A year ago it became real.<br><br>
 
August 7th 2020 was the last day I spoke to my Dad.<br>
I knew the day was coming for years in advance.<br>
Decades.<br><br>
 
He was diagnosed with prostate cancer when I was in 8th grade.<br>
It was a death sentence then.<br>
The period at the end of the sentence became real a year ago.<br><br>
 
His nurse, Angela, told me that his hearing would go last.<br>
To keep talking to him.<br>
To play calm music.<br><br>
 
Naturally, I tested this theory.<br>
I played a song I knew he wouldn’t care about.<br>
I chose a Miles Davis song.<br><br>
 
No reaction.<br><br>
 
Then I played Who Are You by The Who.<br>
An audible grunt.<br>
A tight squeeze on my hand.<br><br>
 
I kept The Who going all day.<br><br>
 
His eyes were closed.<br>
The death rattle began.<br>
I kept talking.<br><br>
 
All about the future.<br>
All about what I planned to do with my life.<br><br>
 
My Dad always called me Mr. Potential.<br>
I wanted him to know what I was going to do.<br>
What I was going to do with the gifts he gave me.<br><br>
 
The gift of gab.<br>
The gift of a smile.<br><br>
 
My Dad died with no one at his side early the next morning.<br>
The way he planned.<br>
The way he wanted it to happen.<br><br>
 
It isn’t about how many people miss you when you’re gone.<br>
Life isn’t about width.<br>
Life is about depth.<br><br>
 
No one made a bigger impact on my life.<br>
I hope to have decades left to spread his wisdom.<br>
To carry out his vision for my future.<br><br>
 
To live up to Mr. Potential.<br><br>
 
Mr. Potential isn’t about wealth.<br>
It isn’t about fame.<br><br>
 
That’s width.<br>
Width is a status game.<br><br>
 
Depth is the impact on the people that matter to you.<br>
Depth is winning.<br><br>
 
My Dad won.<br>
I made sure he knew.<br>

				My phone rang at 4:35am on August 8th, 2020.<br><br>
 
I burst into tears.<br>
I knew why my phone was ringing at 4:35am on a Saturday.<br><br>
 
The nurse told me what I feared.<br>
My Dad died.<br><br>
 
Since that day I’ve called my Dad’s cell phone dozens of times.<br>
It was routine to call him every morning.<br>
Sometimes I forget he’s not here.<br><br>
 
I miss his Worcester accent.<br>
The way he called me:<br>
“Young Grasssshopppppaahhhh!”<br><br>

I miss his way of laughing at my problems.<br>
I'd get mad at him.<br>
Then I'd realize he's dying and my problems are minor.<br><br>

I miss chatting about golf with him.<br>
I miss chatting about anything with him.<br><br>
 
Today I’ll be in Ogunquit spreading his ashes on the Marginal Way.<br>
I’ll look towards the ocean and hear his accent.<br>
I'll sip my coffee and smile.<br><br>

I'm better off today than I was a year ago.<br><br>

I'm not sad he's gone.<br>
I'm smiling that he was once here.<br><br>

Love you all,<br>

				We all have a scallop story.<br>
Here’s mine:<br><br>
 
My sisters and I were picky eaters growing up.<br>
Vegetables were not present.<br>
The fruit I had was from Fruit Roll-Ups.<br><br>
 
Chef Boyardee was a staple.<br>
Large casseroles with cheese.<br>
Spaghetti and meatballs.<br><br>
 
Then one day we were served scallops.<br>
We had to eat all of the scallops and broccoli on our plates.<br>
Or else we went to our room without food.<br><br>
 
It went over about as you’d expect.<br>
Tears.<br>
Screams.<br><br>
 
This time the compromise didn’t come.<br>
We had to eat all of them.<br><br>
 
I’ve repeated this problem recently.<br>
It has nothing to do with scallops.<br>
It has nothing to do with eating healthy.<br><br>
 
I’m comparing myself to my friends.<br><br>
 
One of Mason’s friends will eat an oyster.<br>
I’ll make him try one a month later.<br><br>
 
One of Emma’s friends will say please and thank you on cue.<br>
I’ll make her do it or she won’t get what she wants.<br><br>
 
Mason eating an oyster doesn’t change his appetite.<br>
Emma saying please and thank you because I make her doesn’t change her demeanor.<br><br>
 
I can’t make something a priority one night and make it stick.<br>
My friends with adventurous eaters and polite kids have practiced for years in private.<br><br>
 
Comparison is the thief of joy.<br>
And also, scallops are expensive.<br>
Chef Boyardee rocks.<br>

				We lost a bidding war on a house in Plum Island in 2012.<br>
We didn’t know we were in a bidding war.<br>
…that was our first mistake.<br><br>
 
We lost the house by only $1,500.<br>
We were pissed.<br>
The house was 5 lots from the beach.<br><br>
 
We felt the price was a steal.<br>
Other people must have thought so too.<br><br>
 
We made offers on several houses between 2012-2019.<br><br>
 
We made offers on properties in Ogunquit.<br>
We searched Vermont.<br>
We looked at Rhode Island.<br>
We walked through an open house in Anna Maria Island in Florida.<br><br>
 
Then KG found a property in Westport Massachusetts.<br>
She said it was a “can’t-miss”.<br>
We got the property.<br><br>
 
Weeks later I walked into the barber shop downtown.<br>
Craig the Barber looked at me wide-eyed:<br><br>

“Zack… the property you bought… was it in Westport?!”<br>
I told him it was…<br><br>

“The guy who just left was complaining about losing a house on River Road. Is that the place you got?!”<br><br>
 
Life comes full circle.<br>
I don’t know if the family that lost on the house in Westport are subscribers to The Musings.<br><br>
 
I do know that if we got the house in Plum Island in 2012 our lives would be vastly different.<br>
I’d argue for the worse.<br>
The seven extra years it took to find our property were worth it.<br><br>
 
We got our dream property.<br>
I hope they find theirs.<br>

My Dad loved birds.<br>
He always admired a bird feeder.<br><br>
 
He was color blind.<br>
He didn’t particularly care for red or blue birds.<br>
It was all the same to him.<br><br>
 
He loved their sound.<br>
Their flight.<br>
Their persistence.<br><br>
 
Now, when I walk on the golf course I see them everywhere.<br>
When I’m walking Winnie and Kenzie we admire the sounds of the birds.<br>
Mason and Emma call out the birds they see in the backyard.<br><br>
 
KG and I think that it’s possible my Dad’s spirit is a bird.<br>
My 25-year-old self is laughing at that.<br><br>
 
Believing in spirits in your late 30s?<br>
What are you smoking?<br><br>
 
Yet, there’s no harm in believing.<br><br>
 
When I see the birds I smile.<br>
I whisper “I love you.”<br>
And I don’t feel weird about it.<br><br>
 
I feel calm.<br>
That’s what life is about.<br>
Finding your center.<br>

				You want a big 401K.<br><br>

That way you can retire at 65.<br>
That's what I was taught.<br><br>
 
Get a job.<br>
Make sure they match your 401K.<br>
Invest as much money as possible into your 401K.<br>
Keep the job.<br><br>

My Dad laughed at the system.<br>
He was a financial advisor.<br>
None of his clients had a huge 401K.<br>
All of us would want to be one of his clients.<br><br>
 
They had wealth.<br>
They needed a financial advisor to help them obtain more wealth.<br>
That’s who we want to be.<br><br>
 
I’ll never forget when he broke down the math for me:<br><br>
 
You make $40,000 out of college.<br>
You find a good employer to match your 401K.<br>
You contribute the max.<br>
You get standard raises.<br>
You retire at age 65 with 1.8M+ in your 401K.<br><br>
 
“Life is good, right Zack?”<br><br>
 
I still remember his toothy smile.<br>
The one where I knew he was about to teach me something.<br>
Something he couldn’t wait to tell me.<br><br>
 
“Zack, that’s only about $500,000 in actual money.<br>
Inflation will make that 1.8M feel like $500,000 by the time you’re 65.<br>
That’s not gonna help you.<br>
You gonna live for 20 years on $500,000?”<br><br>
 
That’s why the system is rigged.<br>
I wouldn’t get the 401K money until 2049.<br>
The value of 1.8M in 2049 is a joke.<br><br>
 
It’s one of the reasons I went into entrepreneurship.<br>
It’s one of the reasons I was lucky to be his son.<br>

You have three options:<br><br>
 
1. Apologize. Tell them it’s just water and not pee.<br>
2. Apologize. Tell them your hand is wet and don’t shake their hand.<br>
3. Just shake their hand.<br><br>
 
I don't need you to clarify that the liquid on your hands is not pee.<br><br>

If you peed on your hands in the bathroom and voluntarily chose to leave it there and shake my hand you got a lot of other problems to deal with.<br><br>

				I always tried to give the first referral.<br><br>
 
We network with mortgage lenders.<br>
They refer their clients to get insurance when they purchase a home.<br>
We are their problem-solvers.<br><br>
 
Referring us is “easy”.<br>
In most cases, the majority of their clients cannot close on the property without home insurance.<br><br>
 
"Why wouldn’t they refer us?!<br>
They need us!"<br>
I hear that often from our peers in the insurance industry.<br><br>
 
They don’t refer us when they don’t care.<br>
Believe it or not, that took me years to learn.<br><br>
 
So, I made them care.<br>
I came to meetings with referrals for them.<br>
Mortgage lenders love Realtors.<br>
I had Realtors to refer to them before I even met them for coffee.<br><br>
 
I wanted to give first, always.<br><br>
 
It works even better in my personal life.<br>
In friendship.<br>
In marriage.<br>
In parenting.<br><br>
 
I make my network care by caring about them first.<br><br>

It sounds simple.<br>
It took me years to figure out.<br><br>

When things aren't going well, it's typically because I forgot to care.<br>

				We had a bet.<br><br>
 
My Dad golfed each day he could.<br>
Which meant almost seven days a week.<br>
He never got below a 6 handicap.<br><br>

If I was able to keep a handicap below a 6, my Dad would take me to Bern’s Steak House in Tampa, Florida.<br>
If I didn’t get below a 6 handicap in 2019, I would take my Dad to The Lobster Pound in Ogunquit, Maine.<br><br>
 
The handicap system updated twice a month back then.<br>
Each revision I sent to my Dad.<br>
He howled with laughter when I was a 6.1<br><br>
 
“Zack babe.<br>
The price of lobster is quite high.<br>
Imagine the bill when I order the lobster with all the fixings.<br>
Ohhh, and the chowdahhh!!”<br><br>
 
Then it happened.<br>
I got below a 6.<br>
I kept it below a 6.<br><br>
 
I sent him the revision email in July of 2019.<br>
I still have the email.<br><br>
 
He was real quiet on the phone the next day.<br>
Then he said a phrase I’ll never forget:<br><br>
 
“Well, I guess I was always going to take you to Bern’s.<br>
You don’t come up short.<br>
Never have. Never will.<br>
Well done, young grassshoppppah.”<br><br>
 
Losing with class is harder than winning.<br>
Always.<br>

PS: My Dad never got to take me to Bern's. His health declined rapidly in the end of 2019. Send me an email if you've been there.

				27 has always been my favorite number.<br><br>
 
10/27 is my birthday.<br>
I loved my birthday.<br>
Creativity wasn't my strong suit as a kid.<br><br>

27 became my favorite number.<br><br>
 
When my Dad got sick I had to take over most of his finances, which meant I needed all of his passwords to his phone, voicemail and online resources.<br><br>
 
Many of them had a 27 in them.<br>
Many of them started with 1027.<br><br>
 
I always smiled typing in his passwords to access his accounts.<br>
His passwords were a little ode to me.<br><br>
 
Someday, someone will take over your finances and access your records to help you.<br>
Will they smile at your passwords?<br>
At your notes?<br><br>
 
Your private life eventually becomes your public life to a delicate few.<br>

A little over a year ago My Dad decided he wanted a headstone.<br>
He wanted his ashes to be buried in Southborough.<br><br>
 
This was a curveball.<br><br>
 
He never spoke of a headstone.<br>
We thought he was losing his mind.<br>
…but, it was his wish.<br>
 
I met with my Dad and discussed the details.<br><br>
 
He said the following:<br>
“I want to be buried in Southborough so I’m close to the kids.<br>
I want a view of the water.”<br><br>
 
Southborough is in Central Massachusetts.<br>
There’s no water.<br>
There’s a reservoir, a pond or two.<br>
We don’t live on the water…<br><br>
 
Nevertheless, I met with the town to see what they had available.<br><br>
 
“Shopping” for a site to bury your Dad is something no one talks about.<br>
It’s uncomfortable.<br><br>

You still feel like it’s not gonna happen.<br>
He’s not really gonna die.<br>
This is just precautionary.<br><br>
 
The Rural Cemetery was beautiful.<br>
I tried my best to enjoy the walk.<br><br>
 
Bridget showed me the spot they had available.<br>
It was in the middle of the cemetery.<br>
No water views.<br><br>

“Got a better spot for a guy who loves the water?!<br>
He’d hate how much snow this area gets..”<br><br>
 
We laughed.<br>
She looked at her map.<br><br>
 
“There’s one spot available on the other side of the cemetery.<br>
On Middle Road.<br>
Want to take a look?”<br><br>
 
We drove to the second site.<br>
I took a look at the spot.<br>
It all looked the same to me.<br>
…until I looked to my left.<br><br>
 
There was a clearing.<br>
An opening between the trees.<br>
A clear view of the reservoir.<br>
I couldn’t believe my eyes.<br><br>
 
I told her we’d take it.<br><br>
 
“Sounds good!<br>
Spot 27 is for your Dad.”<br><br>
 
My. Lucky. Number.<br>
With a water view.<br>
Unbelievable.<br>

				My Dad loved music.<br>
Especially while driving.<br><br>
 
One of his favorite songs to drive to was Werewolves of London by Warren Zevon.<br><br>
 
He mumbled for most of the song.<br>
There was one verse of Werewolves of London that he knew:<br><br>
 
“I saw a werewolf drinkin’ a pina colada at Trader Vic’s….<br>
And his hair was perfect.”<br><br>
 
My Dad always sung that part at the top of his lungs.<br>
He was proud of his hair.<br>
There was a connection to that line that was left unsaid.<br><br>
 
He was one of the few guys in his group of friends that had perfect hair.<br>
Very few grays.<br>
Free flowing.<br>
Thick.<br><br>
 
He was never accused of artificial hair.<br>
The guy barely used shampoo.<br>
His friends knew better than to accuse him of that.<br><br>
 
When Warren Zevon talked about the werewolf, my Dad thought he was talking directly to him.<br><br>
 
My Dad’s hair was perfect.<br>

I had to see other sons without their Dad.<br><br>
 
Some call it a support system.<br>
There’s truth to that term.<br>
I think you need to keep the people super tight to you when you’re going through it.<br><br>
 
Having “access” to people isn’t good enough.<br>
They need to be with you as often as possible.<br>

My Dad wanted to be cremated.<br><br>
 
He had specific wishes for his ashes<br>
One of the places was  on the 5th hole of The Haven Country Club.<br><br>
 
He said he won a lot of money on the 5th hole.<br>
He loved the way the hole was shaped for a cut-shot off the tee.<br>
The green slopes from back to front.<br>
It’s receptive to a low-trajectory approach shot.<br><br>
 
It was his favorite hole at the club.<br>
We talked about it for a few weeks.<br>
Then a problem arose…<br><br>
 
“Dad… how are we gonna do that?<br>
It's a private club.<br>
Are Stephanie, Jackie and I gonna sneak on?<br>
Are we gonna ask the golfers to wait on the tee while we spread your ashes?<br>
Are we gonna then look at them and say…<br>
‘Thanks! Have a good round!’<br>
Something feels weird about this…”<br><br>
 
We laughed.<br>
We made alternative plans.<br><br>
 
My Dad passed away on August 8th.<br>
On August 20th I got an email from a Marketing Representative at MAPFRE Insurance.<br>
They were hosting a golf outing for twenty insurance agents and wanted to know if I would play.<br><br>
 
The answer is always “no” from me.<br>
I don’t feel like mingling with other insurance agents in my free time.<br><br>
 
But…<br>
The event was hosted at The Haven Country Club.<br>
Of all the places in the world.<br><br>
 
On 9/28, 51 days after my Dad’s death, I got to spread some of his ashes on his favorite hole.<br><br>

Happy Pizza Friday,<br>

You’ll always have the believers in your life.<br><br>
 
The people that think you can do no wrong.<br>
Your spouse.<br>
Your close friends.<br><br>
 
They are helpful when you walk down an unknown path.<br><br>
 
What you do with the non-believers is more important.<br>
The people that say it’s a bad idea.<br><br>
 
What I did with the cynicism of my competition was the difference.<br>
I didn’t assume they were wrong.<br>
I tried to understand why they would say what they were saying.<br><br>
 
For instance:<br><br>
 
“There’s no money in personal lines insurance…”<br>
True.<br>
Small home and auto policies don't generate a lot of revenue.<br>
Commercial insurance, such as restaurants and trucking, is a better source of income.<br>
But why would they say that?<br><br>
 
I made up a story in my head that they failed at personal lines insurance.<br>
Since they couldn’t do it they didn’t want someone else to succeed at personal lines insurance.<br>
I used it as fire.<br><br>
 
I didn’t investigate why they were right.<br>
That’s a waste of my time.<br><br>
 
I used their opinions as bulletin board material during my journey to the top.<br>

You ever get parenting advice from your friend that doesn’t have kids?<br><br>
 
You can roll your eyes at your friend without kids.<br>
Ultimately, you laugh it off and say:<br>
“They’ll understand eventually.”<br><br>
 
My Dad got the bad advice from the news.<br><br>

He was obsessed with the news.<br>
He would read two or three different newspapers each day.<br>
He’d watch Fox News.<br>
Then CNN.<br>
Then the local news.<br><br>
 
He’d talk to everyone about what was going on.<br>
Locally.<br>
Abroad.<br>
Anywhere.<br><br>
 
He avoided traveling because of the news.<br>
He never went to Israel, or anywhere in Europe.<br>
He got scared of the world.<br><br>
 
The news isn’t the problem.<br>
It’s what you do with the noise that comes from the news.<br>
It’s what you do with the noise that comes from your friends.<br>

				I’ve watched almost every Barstool Pizza Review by Dave Portnoy.<br><br>
 
I love pizza.<br>
Portnoy is a local guy.<br>
The videos are under five minutes.<br><br>
 
But there’s something deeper about the videos.<br><br>
 
He walks into the local pizza store.<br>
Orders the same thing every time.<br>
Then stands outside of the pizza store and gives them a free commercial.<br><br>
 
He tells the audience where the store is.<br>
What it feels like inside.<br>
What the owners are like.<br><br>
 
Then he eats “one bite” outside the store.<br>
There’s always a crowd of people watching him live.<br>
Then hundreds of thousands view the video on YouTube.<br><br>
 
It is the best free advertising possible for a small business.<br><br>
 
The businessowner gets to watch a consumer use their product.<br>
Their facial reactions.<br>
Their body language.<br>
On film.<br><br>
 
This rarely happens for businessowners.<br>
I’ve never seen someone open an insurance policy.<br>
I haven’t been on the other side of the phone to watch them interact with our sales team.<br><br>
 
The pizza store owner can use the feedback.<br>
Good or bad.<br><br>
 
Too much flop?<br>
Too much oil?<br>
Pizza too hot when you serve it?<br><br>
 
Everything is on display.<br>
Their product is naked.<br>
A pizza pro is dissecting their business on a national stage.<br><br>
 
It’s an entrepreneurs dream.<br>
It’s why we do what we do.<br><br>

What would the video look like for your business?<br><br>

I debated not telling my Dad.<br><br>

He had been through enough.<br>
He already felt a lot of anxiety about our future.<br>
Our future without him.<br><br>

The last thing I wanted to do was make him worry.<br><br>

It was 2019.<br>
My foot pain was a constant battle.<br><br>

I had been through multiple doctors.<br>
Physical Therapists.<br>
Chiropractors.<br>
Acupuncturists.<br>
Massage Therapists.<br>
Personal Trainers.<br><br>

It didn't matter.<br>
I was in pain.<br>
With each step.<br><br>

The final diagnosis was hallux rigidus and hereditary gout.<br>
Combined.<br><br>

Hallux rigidus is a bone structure problem.<br>
It feels like you can't bend your big toe.<br>
Imagine trying to walk or lunge without your big toe stretching....<br><br>

It sucks.<br><br>

Hereditary gout is sudden pain attacks, or swelling.<br>
Mostly in your big toe.<br>
Imagine going to bed feeling great, then waking up in the morning and rushing to the ER because your toe is the size of a baseball.<br><br>

It sucks.<br><br>

With my luck, they were both in the same big toe.<br><br>

The diagnosis was pills forever.<br>
To dull the pain.<br>
The avoid gout attacks.<br><br>

I talked with KG about it.<br>
We both thought there had to be another way.<br><br>

I found an article on Medium.<br>
Another on Google.<br>
Then I became a little obsessed.<br>
I read about it all the time.<br><br>

It looked like plant based diets could help.<br><br>

I decided to tell my Dad<br><br>

"Thanks to you..<br>
I'm gonna be that guy.<br>
The guy that orders a salad instead of a steak."<br><br>

My Dad roared with laughter.<br>
"Son, I'm the gift that keeps on giving!"<br><br>

More on our conversation tomorrow.<br>

				My Dad loved chicken wings.<br><br>

He loved a good steak.<br>
Vegetables were allowed on the plate.<br>
As long as they knew they would be left untouched.<br><br>

When I told my Dad that I would be eating plant-based to prevent a gout attack the conversation went about as you'd expect.<br><br>

Some jokes from my Dad.<br>
Some jokes from me.<br><br>

...but there were some serious undertones.<br>
Gout was ever-present in his life.<br>
He had many attacks.<br><br>

He chose to go on pills forever.<br>
He thought pills were the easier way.<br>
I agreed.<br>
...but the plant-based route was an itch I wanted to scratch.<br><br>

My Dad would take his jabs from time to time.<br>
"Took my pills this morning. You eat your lettuce?"<br>
"You should build a garden."<br>
"When you come done we'll have some burgers... oh wait.."<br><br>

I visited him a few months later in the beginning of 2020.<br>
He wanted me to help him organize his closet.<br>
I was digging through files to see which should stay and which should go.<br><br>

Then I saw a folder.<br>
It was labeled:<br>
Plant-Based<br><br>

There were dozens of articles in the folder.<br>
My Dad had been doing his research in silence.<br><br>

I never told him I saw the folder.<br>
I didn't need to.<br><br>

That's who my Dad was.<br>
Always well-read.<br>
About everything.<br>

There’s brotherhood and empathy.<br><br>
 
I have no connection with someone that’s lost their child.<br>
I have empathy.<br>
I can listen.<br>
I can be there for them.<br><br>
 
Ultimately, this is a road I have not traveled.<br><br>
 
I have a deeper connection with my friends that have lost their Dad.<br>
It doesn’t matter how close they were.<br>
It doesn’t matter how he died.<br><br>
 
It’s just a connection.<br>
It’s an instant lean-forward-feeling.<br><br>
 
I don’t care about the ball game.<br>
I don’t care about the cocktail.<br><br>
 
I want to make sure they are OK.<br>
I want to learn what the are doing to get by.<br>
I want to share things that have worked for me.<br><br>

				My Dad didn’t want to join Instagram.<br><br>
 
He wanted me to send him weekly pictures of the kids.<br>
Of events.<br>
Of anything so he could say connected.<br><br>
 
“That’s what Instagram is for, Dad.<br>
Join, and you’ll see them.”<br><br>
 
He thought I was being stubborn.<br>
Alas, he asked me to help him sign up in June of 2018.<br><br>
 
He posted a picture or two.<br>
He commented from time to time.<br>
He didn’t say much about it.<br><br>
 
In July of 2020 I showed up at his assisted living facility without an “appointment”.<br>
I was sick of the COVID protocols.<br>
I knew I was in the wrong, but I was sick of planning to see my Dad.<br>
I wanted to drop-in.<br><br>
 
The front-desk people gave me hell for it.<br>
They eventually let me in.<br>
I walked up to see my Dad and there he was.<br><br>
 
On Instagram.<br><br>
 
I walked up behind him and said:<br>
“Why do you need that?<br>
Take my iPhone.<br>
Tell me which pictures you like.<br>
I’ll go to the pharmacy and have them printed.”<br><br>
 
He roared with laughter:<br><br>
 
“You won young grasshoppah.<br>
Go make an appointment to see me and come back another time.”<br><br>

				I asked my Dad what would make my life a success.<br><br>
 
It was July 2020.<br>
The last July he’d see.<br><br>
 
He paused.<br><br>
 
“I can’t answer that.<br>
Only you can.”<br><br>
 
I thought of that conversation this morning.<br><br>

I was walking the dogs.<br>
My son holding my left hand.<br>
Both dog leashes in my right hand.<br><br>

It was 6:15am.<br>
The sun was creeping over the trees.<br>
Mason pointed to the Moon.<br>
"Doesn't the Moon know it's time for the Sun?"<br><br>

He gave his "I roasted you" giggle.<br><br>

We took a right turn down Whistler Lane.<br>
The long way.<br>
Some extra time for the dogs.<br><br>

I’m always wondering if I’m on the right path.<br>
If I’m using my one chance the right way.<br><br>
 
I think back to my Dad's reply:<br>
"I can't answer that.<br>
Only you can."<br><br>

Right now...<br>
An extra fifteen minutes down Whistler Lane feels like success.<br><br>

Find your Whistler Lane.<br>

Headache.<br>
Sore throat.<br>
Sneezing.<br>
Coughing.<br><br>
 
Didn’t matter.<br>
I was there.<br><br>

Given what we’ve been through with COVID…<br><br>
 
I won’t go into work sick.<br>
I won’t go out sick.<br>
I won’t go anywhere if I’m sick.<br><br>
 
Tomorrow is coming.<br>
Just about anything can wait.<br><br>

The drinks with friends.<br><br>

My Dad died with a lot of regrets.<br><br>
 
The house on the water was near the top.<br><br>
 
He spoke of it often.<br>
A small house on the cliffs in California.<br>
With water views.<br><br>
 
He wanted to buy it.<br>
The asking price was $44,000.<br>
That’s about $300,000 adjusted to today.<br><br>
 
They couldn’t afford the house in cash.<br>
He had just started his company.<br>
They didn’t want to go into too much debt too early.<br><br>
 
He had a million excuses.<br><br>
 
Later in his life he would look at the value of the house on Zillow.<br>
He’d hang his head and tell me it was one of his biggest regrets.<br><br>

In 2019, I told him that KG and I decided to purchase a house in Westport.<br>
He disagreed.<br>
Not with the idea.<br>
With the execution.<br><br>

He thought we were stretching ourselves too thin.<br>
He thought there would be a better time.<br>
Maybe a property with a lower price.<br><br>
 
I brought up the California property.<br>
He smiled.<br>
Not a toothy smile.<br>
More of a grin.<br><br>

I told him I wasn't interested.<br>
"The kids don't care at this age.<br>
It's a lot of work.<br>
I'm out a lot of nights."<br><br>

I had every excuse in the book.<br><br>

Then he said the line.<br>
The Dad line of all Dad lines:<br><br>

"Well son...<br>
He'll either be coached by you or by another Dad."<br><br>

I drove away angry that night.<br>
Angry because he was right.<br><br>

I made up a story in my head that someone else should coach Mason in basketball. <br>
Someone with "more time".<br>
Someone who has "done it before".<br><br>

That's garbage.<br>
No one is qualified.<br>
Someone just does it.<br>
That's how they get "experience".<br><br>

Fast forward two years...<br>
My Dad is gone.<br>
His words are not.<br><br>

Tonight was the last night of my four-week basketball clinic.<br>
The clinic was for boys and girls ages 6-8 years old.<br>
It was free.<br>
45 people signed up.<br><br>

The highlight of the clinic happened tonight.<br>
There was a young girl that came the first week.<br>
She had never touched a basketball before.<br><br>

Tonight she made her first shot.<br>
It was on a 10-foot-hoop.<br>
She ran towards her Dad and gave him a hug.<br>
"I did it! I did it!"<br><br>

My heart melted.<br>
On the way home Mason said to me:<br><br>

"Dad... you know what I was thinking about today?<br>
You are the best coach I've ever had."<br><br>

The Young Grasshopper is still learning.<br>

My Dad’s death didn’t feel magical.<br><br>
 
It felt like I lost my soul.<br>
My way.<br><br>
 
It felt unfair.<br>
Until I started to write about it.<br><br>
 
Then I realized there were magical stories I ignored.<br>
Stories I told KG about but didn’t think about.<br>
Moments that couldn’t be explained.<br><br>
 
Many of you have emailed me referencing a “God wink”.<br>
A “sign”.<br><br>
 
I didn’t see the winks or the signs.<br>
I saw tears.<br>
I saw sleepless nights.<br><br>
 
When I look back at my writings they are filled with pain.<br>
Lessons came from pain.<br><br>
 
The early days with your kids.<br>
The first few weeks in your new house or new state.<br>
The first few days at your new company.<br><br>
 
There’s joy.<br>
There are smiles.<br><br>
 
There’s also a lot of pain.<br>
The Daily Musings came from pain.<br><br>
 
Your next great adventure may come from your lowest moment.<br>
Take notes.<br><br>

We were 26.<br><br>
 
Then we met some of our clients in person.<br>
The reaction was always the same:<br>
“You’re much younger than I thought!”<br><br>
 
It wasn’t said in a bad way.<br>
It wasn’t said in a positive way either.<br><br>
 
It was merely a fact.<br><br>
 
We were 26.<br>
We knew our product.<br>
We had seen the service in action.<br><br>
 
But…<br><br>
 
I didn’t own a home.<br>
I hadn’t experience a home insurance claim, personally.<br>
Yet, I was selling a service to help others if they had a home insurance claim.<br><br>
 
I wonder how successful we would have been with our faces front-and-center.<br>
I wonder how trustworthy I would’ve looked in my baggy Men’s Warehouse suit.<br><br>
 
My 26-year-old past self says:<br>
“I’m up for the challenge.”<br>
 
That was the difference maker.<br>
I wanted to prove that age didn’t matter.<br><br>
 
I’m still trying to do that now.<br>

I’ve always kept a journal.<br><br>
 
To record what I’m feeling.<br>
What I did that day.<br>
What I want to do tomorrow.<br><br>
 
I have them from prior years.<br>
I don’t recall looking at them.<br>
Ever.<br><br>
 
I don’t use journals to learn from the past.<br>
I use them to get my thoughts out without venting to other people.<br><br>
 
Good vibes and bad times.<br>
No sentence structure.<br>
Sometimes I just draw.<br><br>
 
If you were to read the journals you may think I’ve had a tough life.<br>
I haven’t.<br>
I think I’ve had an easy life with some difficult moments.<br><br>
 
My journal may read differently.<br><br>
 
I wonder about the autobiographies of our ancestors.<br>
Journals from centuries ago.<br><br>

Did Marcus Aurelius ever anticipate The Meditations to become required reading?<br><br>

What if my journals became widespread reading?<br>
I wouldn’t be able to give a spin.<br>
To provide context.<br>
I’d be long gone.<br>
People would be reading my most vulnerable moments.<br><br>
 
Scary thought.<br>
But that’s how we’ve grown as a society.<br><br>
 
From imperfections.<br>

My best writing comes with the windows open.<br><br>
 
Preferably when its windy or rainy.<br>
With our dogs Kenzie or Winnie at my feet.<br><br>
 
I can feel the wind at my back.<br>
I can feel their heartbeat in my toes.<br><br>
 
I have a blank page.<br>
A warm coffee.<br>
A large water.<br><br>
 
I’m surrounded by books.<br>
Pictures of my family.<br>
Memories of my Dad.<br><br>
 
I’m at peace.<br><br>
 
My worst writing comes when I have a deadline.<br>
I have nothing written for the Musings tomorrow.<br>
My phone is within reach.<br>
Likely with Twitter or Instagram open.<br>
The kids are doing something fun downstairs.<br>
I can hear Emma’s laughter.<br>
I can hear Mason’s footsteps.<br>
I can feel KG’s smile.<br><br>
 
I don’t want to be writing.<br>
I’m doing it because I have to.<br><br>
 
I close my laptop.<br>
I go back downstairs.<br><br>
 
Writing can wait.<br><br>
 
People say to be where your feet are.<br>
That’s true.<br>
You need your feet to be where your heart desires.<br>

“I’m sorry, no dogs allowed.”<br><br>
 
I was crushed.<br>
It was Mason’s first football game.<br>
I had Winnie with me.<br>
It was a big mistake.<br><br>
 
I couldn’t be on the grounds with our dog.<br><br>
 
My mind immediately went into panic mode.<br>
“I’m going to miss his first game.<br>
I’m going to the only Dad not there.<br>
He’s going to be upset.”<br><br>
 
I found his coach and left Mason with his team.<br>
Winnie and I sprinted to the car.<br>
I whipped the car into reverse.<br><br>
 
That’s when the button fell off my dashboard.<br>
The button with my picture of my friend Yac.<br>
He died in a car accident a few weeks ago.<br><br>
 
I put the car in park.<br>
I bent over and grabbed the button.<br>
I took a long look at Yac.<br><br>
 
Then I remembered….<br>
We got to the field 45 minutes before the game started.<br>
The team had to practice first.<br><br>
 
I had plenty of time to get home and drive back.<br><br>
 
I took a deep breath and drove slowly with Winnie.<br><br>
 
I got back to the field 15 minutes before the game started.<br><br>
 
This may sound like no big deal to you.<br>
But, I would’ve been driving very fast without the button.<br>
Without my reminder.<br><br>
 
My brain made up a story that was not real.<br><br>
 
If you want to make a true change, you need a physical reminder to defeat your brain.<br>

My Dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer in his late 40s.<br><br>
 
The average age of prostate cancer diagnosis was around 65.<br>
He considered prostate cancer a death sentence.<br><br>
 
He went into a tailspin.<br><br>
 
For some that means depression.<br>
For my Dad, it meant gambling and golf.<br>
A lot.<br>
Almost every day.<br><br>
 
He gained weight.<br>
He hit “rock-bottom” in his own way.<br><br>
 
Then he hired a personal trainer.<br>
He started going to the gym a few days a week.<br>
He started to hit the ball further on the golf course.<br>
He started to walk around the house with no shirt on.<br><br>
 
He got in the best shape of his life.<br>
He looked… proud.<br><br>
 
A year later he got the bad news.<br>
His prostate cancer metastasized to colon cancer.<br><br>
 
The five-year survival rate for prostate cancer that metastasizes is under 30%.<br><br>
 
My Dad never set foot in a gym again.<br><br>
 
The gym didn’t prevent the cancer from metastasizing.<br>
Getting in shape didn’t help his genes.<br><br>
 
The next time I saw him without his shirt on was in Florida.<br>
Swimming with Mason in his pool.<br><br>
 
He was overweight.<br>
His skin was as white as rice.<br>
He looked… proud.<br><br>
 
His grandkids became his personal trainer.<br>
They helped him beat the odds.<br>
He lived over 22 years with cancer.<br>

Continued thoughts from our Musings yesterday..<br><br>

"Did it upset you that your Dad stopped working out?"<br><br>

At the time...<br>
Tremendously.<br><br>

A few years later...<br>
Tremendously.<br><br>

I thought he was a quitter.<br>
I thought he didn't care.<br><br>

I didn't understand death.<br>
I didn't understand pain.<br>
I didn't understand mental health.<br><br>

Life makes a lot more sense in reverse.<br><br>

The last year of his life I had a different view of his health.<br><br>

The past didn't matter.<br>
The events that lead to his demise didn't matter.<br><br>

What mattered was the days.<br>
The hours.<br>
The minutes.<br>
Whatever I had left.<br><br>

Extra days at the gym may have helped.<br>
We'll never know.<br><br>

He chose the golf course.<br>
He chose the casino.<br>
He chose his friends.<br><br>

Hopefully you'll get to choose too.<br>

Tracy Chapman performing at Wembley is one of my favorite videos on YouTube.<br><br>
 
It’s not a song you’ll hear in my car.<br>
We don’t play it at home.<br>
It isn’t about the lyrics or the tune.<br><br>
 
It’s about her.<br>
How she strums the guitar to get started.<br>
In front of 60,000 people at Wembley Stadium.<br><br>
 
I’m captivated.<br><br>
 
She deploys a technique we can all use.<br><br>
 
She looks down at her guitar for the first few notes.<br>
She doesn’t make eye contact with anything but her guitar.<br>
She sways.<br><br>
 
She plays the intro for fourteen seconds.<br>
Now she’s in a flow-state.<br><br>
 
The crowd is gone.<br>
She may as well be in her basement.<br>
The act is already a success before she sings the first word.<br><br>
 
Professional golfers use the same style.<br>
They are rarely still before a shot.<br>
They are moving something.<br>
Their feet bounce.<br>
Their fingers tap.<br><br>
 
They call it a “trigger”.<br><br>
 
If you're stuck, find your sway.<br>
Don't look at anything but your "guitar".<br><br>

Screw the audience.<br> 
It isn't about them.<br>
This is about you.<br><br>

Happy Pizza Friday,<br>
-ZG<br><br>

"What would you do in the last hour of your life?"<br><br>

I will watch The Man in the Red Bandana this morning.<br>
It's my tradition.<br>
My way of remembering the events of 9/11.<br><br>

The story.<br>
The narration.<br>
The interviews.<br><br>

I'm captivated each time.<br>
I cry each time.<br><br>

It's how I want to start 9/11.<br>
Being moved to tears.<br><br>

I'll never forget where I was when 9/11 happened.<br>
I'll never forget where I was when I asked KG to marry me.<br>
I'll never forget where I was when I got the phone call that my Dad died.<br><br>

There are moments in life you'll always remember.<br>
Very few.<br><br>

We live our lives thinking these moments will keep coming.<br>
More and more will pile up.<br><br>

The truth is they don't.<br>
There are only a few that change who you are.<br><br>

I didn't lose anyone close to me on 9/11.<br>
That's why I watch The Man with the Red Bandana.<br><br>

It's my reminder that I'm lucky.<br>
It's my reminder of the type of person I want Emma and Mason to be.<br>
It's my reminder of the type of man I need to be.<br><br>

It's a reminder that tomorrow isn't guaranteed.<br><br>

It's perfect.<br><br>

Take a moment today and reflect.<br>

				Brian David Sweeney called his wife, Julie.<br><br>

He was a passenger on Flight 175.<br>
Flight 175 was headed for Los Angeles.<br>
Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center.<br><br>

The plane had been hijacked.<br>
Here is the transcript of his voicemail to Julie:<br><br>

Jules, this is Brian.<br>
Listen, I'm on an airplane that's been hijacked.<br>
If things don't go well...<br>
and it's not looking good.<br>
I just want you to know that I absolutely love you.<br><br>

I want you to do good. <br>
Go have good times.<br><br>

Same to my parents, and everybody.<br>
And I just totally love you.<br>
And I'll see you when you get there...<br>
Bye Babe, I hope I call you.<br><br>

I had this type of conversation with my Dad.<br>
When it was completely over.<br>
When there was nothing left for him to say.<br><br>

He did what Brian did.<br>
He wished me well.<br>
He made me feel like I was prepared for the journey ahead.<br>
Without him.<br><br>

I listened to Brian's voicemail today and I heard my Dad's last words.<br>
It's chilling.<br>
It takes me back to the exact moment.<br>
Lying in bed with him.<br><br>

I consider myself lucky.<br>
Based on the interviews I can find with Julie...<br>
she considers herself lucky too.<br>
For that voicemail.<br>
The closure.<br><br>

Most of the survivors of 9/11 didn't get a voicemail.<br>
They didn't get the last call from their loved ones.<br><br>

I did.<br>
You may.<br><br>

Next week...<br>
Next month...<br>
Pretend your Brian.<br><br>

Who would you call?<br>
What would you say?<br>

Writing is lonely.<br><br>
 
Poets have a suicide rate 5X higher than the general population.<br>
Writers have a high rate of emotional disorders.<br><br>
 
After I year of writing, I understand why.<br><br>
 
You write by yourself.<br>
You edit by yourself.<br>
You publish by yourself.<br><br>
 
If you receive fame, it feels unwarranted.<br><br>
 
A few weeks ago I was overwhelmed with the feedback from a Musing.<br>
I had dozens of emails to reply to.<br>
Texts and phone calls.<br><br>
 
It was unexpected.<br>
“That was my worst piece of writing...<br>
I didn’t intend for the Musing to be taken that way.”<br><br>
 
I gave myself no credit.<br>
I didn't think about when I wrote the Musing.<br>
I had cried when I finished writing the passage.<br><br>
 
I didn’t think of that moment.<br>
I thought of the fact that I misused a pronoun.<br>
I kicked myself for not seeing it when I shipped the Musing.<br><br>
 
When awards and fame come from work, we celebrate.<br>
That doesn’t happen in writing.<br>
Especially if you ship your work each day.<br><br>
 
Tomorrow is coming.<br>
I better not mistake a make.<br>

				Norm Macdonald died after a secret battle.<br><br>

That's the headline you read yesterday.<br><br>

Few people knew!<br>
He didn't want people to treat him differently!<br>
Can you believe he kept it a secret?!<br><br>

Yes.<br>
I can.<br><br>

I couldn't convince my Dad to call people he loved at the end.<br>
He didn't want to tell anyone he was dying.<br>
He just wanted to disappear to most.<br>
And matter to few.<br><br>

Imagine how different Norm's life would have been the last five years...<br><br>

Every interview would have been a tribute.<br>
His comedic performances would've been a retirement ceremony.<br><br>

Cheers to Norm.<br>
I'm glad he did it his way.<br><br>

He said it best:<br>
"I'm pretty sure... I'm not a doctor.<br>
But I'm pretty sure if you die, the cancer dies at the same time.<br>
That's not a loss.<br>
That's a draw."<br><br>

To all of us with secret battles...<br>
Keep fighting.<br>

				Fifteen years ago I made a big decision.<br><br>

It felt minor at the time.<br>
It was the choice between living near New York City of Boston.<br>
It also involved a girl named Kristin.<br><br>
 
KG was known as Kristin in 2006.<br>
We had been dating for a few months.<br>
She found a job in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<br>
That was 151 miles away from my job in Connecticut.<br><br>
 
She said, “This was fun… but…”<br>
She may have said it in a different way.<br>
That’s how I heard it.<br><br>

I had to made a decision.<br>
Fast.<br><br>

It wasn't New York City or Boston.<br>
It was being with Kristin or starting a new chapter.<br><br>

Getting a job when you're 22 isn't easy.<br>
Asking for a location change before your first day is even harder.<br>
Especially when you can't tell them it's for a girl.<br><br>
 
My first sale at Liberty Mutual was convincing them to transfer me to Boston.<br><br>

I called the manager in Bridgeport.<br>
He told me it wasn't possible.<br><br>

I drove to Boston to meet with the manager.<br>
I didn't call him.<br>
I didn't email him.<br><br>

Tom Dunne, the manager in Boston, was impressed.<br>
"You drove all the way here to ask me a question?"<br>
I became their first new sales representative in Boston in over six years.<br><br>
 
Kristin agreed to continue dating.<br>
That decision was over fifteen years ago.<br><br>

I didn’t make the drive because I thought Kristin and I would get married.<br>
We had been dating for a few months.<br>
It was our senior year of college.<br><br>
 
Being with Kristin > Being without Kristin<br>
Boston > Bridgeport<br>
“Sure, let’s go for it.”<br><br>
 
Fifteen years later, I still think I’m lucky.<br>
Fifteen years later, I still think I won the marriage lottery.<br>
Fifteen years later, I still think about that drive to Boston.<br><br>

Go for it.<br>

Total Wine is a massive store.<br><br>
 
They have over 200 locations.<br>
They are in 23 states.<br>
The price of their wine and spirits is as low as it can be.<br><br>
 
Some would argue it is too low.<br><br>
 
They were sued by the Alcohol Beverage Control Commission for selling spirits under the wholesale cost, which is forbidden.<br><br>
 
Meaning, they were selling the alcohol for cheaper than they paid for it.<br><br>
 
They won the lawsuit.<br>
They were able to prove that they bought in massive quantities.<br>
They were selling the alcohol for more than they were paying for it.<br>
The other stores just couldn’t afford to buy in large quantities.<br><br>
 
Total Wine considered it a victory for consumers.<br>
You and I could argue it is a loss for small business operators.<br><br>
 
How can you compete with a giant that can price products for less than you can?<br><br>
 
Sounds like Amazon…<br><br>
 
When I walk into a Total Wine I’m greeted by a gentlemen looking at his phone.<br>
He says, “How ya doing?” but doesn’t look up from his phone.<br>
The wine I want is impossible to find.<br>
The store is about as organized as Emma’s sock drawer (a total mess).<br><br>
 
There are opportunities to compete with Total Wine.<br>
There are opportunities to compete with Amazon.<br><br>
 
You and I cannot change the price-focused behavior of our target consumer.<br>
That’s a battle we cannot win.<br><br>
 
I’d rather figure out how to charge twice as much.<br>
That’s what I love working on.<br>
That’s what I will be working on.<br><br>

I love nicknames.<br><br>
 
It’s a chance to design your name.<br>
To own it.<br><br>
 
I haven’t heard “Zachary” in decades.<br>
I never felt like a Zachary.<br><br>
 
Kristin has been called KG or Mom around our house for years.<br><br>
 
We have a bunch of names for Mason.<br>
We call him Mase, Maso, and The Maso.<br><br>
 
We have a bunch of names for Emma.<br>
We call her Buzzy, Emma B and Em.<br><br>
 
Last year we asked Mason what his friends call him.<br>
“What’s your nickname??”<br><br>
 
He chewed his food.<br>
Had a sip of water.<br>
Then slowly turned and looked at us.<br><br>
 
“They call me Grip.”<br><br>
 
We nearly fell over.<br><br>
 
“GRIP?! How did we not know?! Why Grip?!”<br><br>
 
He looked at us and calmly said:<br><br>
 
“The other day James and I were playing and I was gripping everything really good. They started calling me Grip. Everyone calls me Grip at school…”<br><br>
 
We were baffled.<br>
How the heck did we not know?<br>
He's only six, we should know these things.<br><br>

Then, we heard his distinctive laugh…<br><br>
 
“ROASTED! Totally roasted you!!!”<br><br>
 
No one calls him Grip.<br>
Until now.<br>
That nickname will stick.<br><br>
 
We’re roasting you back, Grip.<br>

I feared life without my Dad.<br><br>
 
I called him each morning.<br>
He was the person I relied on for advice.<br>
For centering me when I was angry.<br>
For bringing me back to reality when I was high on myself.<br><br>
 
Our kids adored him.<br>
He had no agenda when we got together.<br>
There was nothing to see.<br>
Nothing to do.<br>
Just time.<br>
The kids loved the simplicity of presence.<br><br>
 
KG could do no wrong.<br>
When he’d visit us, he’d spend more time with KG than me.<br>
They had coffee together each morning.<br>
They picked up the kids together from daycare.<br>
KG tolerated Fox News blasting all morning while she tried to work.<br><br>
 
“Whatever you do Young Grasshoppah…<br>
Don’t lose her.”<br><br>
 
Now it’s been a little over a year.<br>
The sun shined brightly on August 8th 2020 when he died.<br>
It’s shining this morning too.<br><br>
 
We all miss him.<br>
There was nothing to fear.<br><br>

I’m not afraid of missing someone anymore.<br>
It’s a sign they mattered.<br>

I love to give-back to UConn.<br><br>
 
I give back with my time.<br>
I’ve been a mentor for the School of Business every year since 2015.<br>
I’ve taught classes at the School of Business for the last two years.<br>
I’ve keynoted an orientation speech for incoming Freshman.<br><br>
 
Every session has the same focus:<br>
Learn how to sell yourself.<br>
Not a product.<br>
Not a service.<br><br>
 
Learn how to sell yourself.<br>
Not on social media.<br>
Not on the internet.<br><br>

Learn how to sell yourself...<br>
to yourself.<br><br>
 
Some call it confidence.<br>
I call it self-talk.<br><br>
 
What do you say to yourself when no one is listening?<br><br>
 
That’s the conversation college kids need to master.<br>
Life gets easier when you believe in yourself.<br>

“Best of” awards make me laugh.<br><br>
 
If you’re a marketer, you know the drill.<br>
You research local awards.<br>
You find out what it will take to win.<br>
You create a PR campaign to get it done.<br>
You celebrate the achievement and create collateral.<br><br>
 
If you’re a consumer, you are swayed by the award.<br>
Whether you believe it or not.<br>
Popular opinion influences you.<br><br>

The game makes sense.<br>
My question is…<br><br>
 
How many votes do these awards get?<br><br>
 
In 2012, I found out about The Best of Natick Award.<br>
Natick was where we founded G&N Insurance.<br>
I found out about the award three days before the deadline for votes.<br><br>
 
I voted.<br>
I didn’t tell anyone else about the award.<br>
I didn’t even ask KG to vote.<br><br>
 
We came in second place.<br>
I used it in our campaigns.<br>
“Second Place in Best of Natick.”<br><br>
 
No one ever asked me who came in first.<br><br>

The Best of Natick Award doesn't exist anymore.<br>
But we do...<br>
We're still chugging along in second place.<br>

				My Dad answered the phone the same way each morning.<br><br>
 
“Hey Buddy, everything OK?”<br><br>
 
He meant it.<br>
He was worried that something was wrong.<br>
Every morning.<br><br>

Yesterday I met Mason at the bus stop and said:<br>
“Hey Buddy, how ya doing?”<br><br>
 
He looked at me like I had four heads.<br><br>

“Dad, I’m great.<br>
I’m smiling.<br>
Can’t you see??”<br><br>
 
My Dad never changed the way he picked up the phone.<br>
Maybe in 31 years Mason will be writing about me too.<br><br>

My Dad didn't understand my smile...<br>

I have hundreds of videos of her laugh.<br>

I look at her sometimes and get lost.<br>
I can't believe we created someone so gorgeous.<br><br>

We have a deal.<br><br>
 
Mason has three objectives:<br>
Play hard.<br>
Listen to your coach.<br>
Cheer on your friends.<br><br>
 
If he gets it done, we go out to dinner together after his football practice.<br><br>
 
We try to find a new place each week.<br>
He prefers loud music.<br>
Dark restaurants.<br>
Places where “adults eat”.<br><br>
 
It’s my favorite time to ask him questions.<br>
To watch him interact with the waitress.<br>
To see how he deals with adversity.<br><br>

I try to ask open questions.<br>
Questions about how he views himself.<br>
Questions about where he wants to grow.<br>
What he wants to do.<br>
What he's struggling with.<br><br>

I let him communicate with the waitress.<br>
I won't order for him.<br>
He's gotta figure it out himself.<br>
He needs to read the menu.<br>
To ask questions to the waitress.<br>
To get what he wants.<br><br>

Adversity is the hardest part for him.<br><br>

Places where "adults eat" are slower.<br>
Louder.<br>
Busier.<br><br>

His meal takes forever.<br>
The staff messes up his drink order.<br><br>

I'm less concerned with his words.<br>
I'm focused on his mannerisms.<br>
How he acts with adversity.<br><br>
 
Mason is six.<br>
Open ended questions, interactions and adversity are still difficult for me at 37.<br>
That's why we're working on it now.<br><br>

Happy Pizza Friday,<br>

We tried to explain tips to Mason tonight.<br><br>

It's for good service.<br>
It's not required, but it shows good manners.<br><br>

We quickly realized it's not an easy topic.<br>
KG and I both stumbled through the description.<br><br>

We arrived at Framingham Country Club a few minutes later.<br>
I forgot to give them a few dollars after my golf round today.<br>
I gave Mason $20 and told him to ask for $10 back.<br><br>

He proudly gave Brian $20.<br>
He got the $10 back and said:<br><br>

"OK, let's give the other $10 to James.<br>
He needs it."<br><br>

James is one of Mason's best friends.<br>
He's six.<br>
I asked Mason what he needed it for.<br><br>

"I forgot to give him $10.<br>
He made me laugh today."<br><br>

We decided to use the $10 towards a gift for James.<br>
An appreciation gift.<br>
Mason changed the lesson on tips to a lesson on kindness.<br><br>

He's going places.<br>

It was a few days before my Dad’s birthday.<br>
The first birthday I’d celebrate with him in the ground.<br><br>
 
I couldn’t figure out what to do.<br>
I knew I wasn’t the first person to lose their Dad.<br>
…but it hurt.<br><br>
 
I felt alone.<br><br>
 
300 days ago I decided to send an email to a small group of people.<br>
300 days ago I committed to sending an email each day.<br>
300 days ago was the last day I felt alone.<br><br>
 
Here’s what I’ve learned from writing each day for 300 days:<br><br>
 
Writing each day is easy.<br>
Shipping your work each day is challenging.<br><br>
 
Keeping your thoughts private is selfish.<br>
There are thousands of people that need to know they aren’t alone.<br><br>
 
I look at the world differently today.<br>
I’m curious.<br>
I ask more questions.<br>
I take more notes.<br><br>
 
The third draft is the best draft of my Musings.<br>
So I give myself a little grace for what I say.<br>
When I speak, it’s the first draft every time.<br><br>
 
Writing doesn’t mean you know the answer.<br>
Writing helps you understand the situation.<br><br>
 
Life goes on.<br>
With...<br>
Or without you.<br>

				Supporting friends is easier said than done.<br><br>
 
Think about your friend that’s a financial advisor.<br>
Your friend that sells cars.<br>
Your friend that sells nutritional products.<br>
Your friend that works at a restaurant.<br><br>
 
You could help them.<br><br>
 
Repost their advertisements.<br>
Direct your friends to their services.<br>
Attend their events.<br><br>
 
You don’t have to purchase anything from them.<br><br>
 
But, you don’t.<br>
You’re busy.<br>
You will next time.<br><br>
 
It’s like at the end of your workout.<br>
There’s a core exercise.<br>
But you’re tired.<br>
“I’ll do it later.”<br><br>
 
You never do.<br>
You push it off.<br><br>
 
When you do the sit-ups during the workout you feel awesome.<br>
When you support your friends you feel awesome.<br><br>
 
Why don’t we do it more?<br><br>
 
That’s the entrepreneur dilemma.<br>
The entrepreneur has to figure out how to get their friends to do the sit-ups.<br>
Now.<br>
Not later.<br>

				KG took a candid photo of my Dad and I.<br>
The date was March 12, 2020.<br><br>
 
It sits in my “Favorites” folder.<br><br>
 
My Dad and I are sitting in our living room.<br>
There’s a few pictures of Spider-Man drawn by Mason in the distance.<br>
We're about to turn the TV on.<br>
My Dad is covered in blankets.<br>
Two are visible.<br>
There’s a third underneath him.<br><br>
 
The stock market was plummeting.<br>
It was the largest one-day percentage drop since Black Monday.<br>
My Dad was furious.<br><br>
 
He had weeks left to live.<br>
At best months.<br>
And he wanted to monitor the Stock Market.<br><br>
 
At the time I laughed.<br>
I didn’t understand his obsession.<br>
He had no money to invest.<br>
His clients were no longer his clients.<br><br>
 
Yet, he cared.<br><br>
 
He cared about a future he would not see.<br>
He cared about the future of his past-clients he would not witness.<br>
He cared until the end.<br><br>
 
I hope you and I do too.<br>
That’s why it is in my Favorites folder.<br><br>

I promised my Dad I’d take him to Vegas.<br><br>
 
We needed something to hope for.<br>
Something to think about in the future.<br>
To distract him from the moment.<br><br>
 
The moment was bone cancer.<br>
The path forward was chemo.<br><br>
 
We needed a distraction.<br>
That became Vegas.<br><br>
 
We dreamt about it.<br><br>

My Dad loved the thrill of gambling.<br>
How much he won or lost didn't matter.<br>
The art of gambling attracted him more than the money.<br><br>

We talked about the first class plane tickets.<br>
We talked about the hotel.<br>
We talked about him teaching me how to play Craps.<br><br>

Vegas became a weekly conversation.<br>
I'd ask him a specific question on Craps.<br>
I'd ask him his favorite meal he's had in Vegas.<br>
Anything to get him talking about the future.<br><br>
 
We got the idea from a Lou Holtz speech.<br>
He promised his wife he’d take her to the “holy land”.<br>
To Israel.<br>
It got her through a tough time.<br><br>
 
They got to Israel.<br>
We didn’t get to Vegas.<br><br>
 
It still got us through a tough time.<br><br>
 
The Lou Holtz speech is a must-listen.<br>

				Social media influencers messed with my head.<br><br>
 
Most are there for good.<br>
They are there to entertain.<br>
To educate.<br>
To sell.<br><br>
 
Some convinced me to change my style.<br>
To use certain hashtags.<br>
To post a certain number of times per day.<br>
To engage.<br>
To be… them.<br><br>
 
Looking back, I have no idea why I tried to be them.<br>
I wasn't after followers.<br>
Followers aren’t customers.<br><br>

Influencers convince us that social media matters.<br>

				This is the 305th Daily Musing.<br><br>

This is my 331st draft.<br>
Almost 10% of my drafts stay as drafts.<br><br>

That means 90% of what I write is delivered to you.<br><br>

This is my 305th Daily Musing.<br>
About once a month I tell KG about the Daily Musing that comes out the next day.<br><br>

That means 3% of what I write makes me proud.<br><br>

Yet, I still take a swing each day.<br>
Because this isn't about me.<br>
It's about giving.<br>
It's about serving.<br><br>

I'm inspired by the people I've met through the journey.<br>
The people that tell me the Daily Musings matter.<br><br>

If I wrote without an audience, I'd be proud 3% of the time.<br>
And I'd give up after a month.<br><br>

That's why we stop going to the gym.<br>
That's why we have trouble keeping healthy habits.<br><br>

We're only proud 3% of the time, because it's always about us.<br><br>

Can you make your habit about someone else?<br>
Can you make it public?<br>
Can you grind through the 3% self-approval?<br><br>

Gould & Williams was the original name.<br>
It became Steven J Gould Financial Strategies.<br><br>
 
My Dad found out his partner was stealing funds from the firm.<br>
His partner was engaging in illegal activities.<br>
They agreed to split and go their separate ways.<br><br>
 
Before websites.<br>
Before social media.<br>
Before I was born.<br><br>
 
I asked him a lot about those days.<br>
The days after the split.<br>
How he dealt with his former partner.<br><br>
 
His replies were short.<br>
To the point.<br>
“I’m lucky I got out when I did…”<br><br>
 
I asked him if he kept in touch with Williams.<br>
If he wondered how he was doing.<br>
If he was still practicing financial planning.<br><br>
 
His replies were short.<br>
To the point.<br>
“I never thought to keep in touch with him.”<br><br>
 
My Dad didn’t wish people well when he parted ways.<br>
He didn’t wish ill upon them either.<br>
He just moved on.<br>
And never looked back.<br><br>
 
Even at the end.<br><br>
 
I asked him a lot about Williams.<br>
If there were any regrets.<br>
He didn’t have any.<br><br>
 
It’s easy to monitor how people are doing in our social media world.<br>
You can look at previous relationships.<br>
Your old employer.<br><br>
 
It’s easy to not move forward.<br>
My Dad’s split is a reminder.<br>
To leave behind what no longer serves you.<br>

“Tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.”<br><br>
 
I used to say that all the time.<br><br>
 
It’s true.<br>
But it was meaningless.<br>
I didn’t know what it looked like.<br><br>
 
I saw every tomorrow.<br>
I couldn’t imagine it any other way.<br><br>
 
Yet, I’d say it like I was giving advice to someone.<br><br>
 
I read Meditations a few years ago.<br>
Marcus Aurelius summarized a thought by Epictetus:<br><br>

As you kiss your son good night, whisper to yourself:<br>
‘He may be dead in the morning’<br><br>
 
What if my kids don’t wake up tomorrow?<br>
That’s what "tomorrow isn’t guaranteed" means.<br><br>
 
Marcus was writing from personal experience.<br>
He lost nine children.<br><br>
 
I’m glad I read the book during my Dad’s last chapter.<br>
I was able to whisper to myself:<br>
“He may be dead in the morning.”<br><br>
 
I thought about it often in 2020.<br>
I took advantage of each day with my Dad.<br><br>
 
Tomorrow wasn’t guaranteed one time with him.<br>
And I have no regrets.<br><br>
 
Whisper to yourself today.<br>

In my 20s I was angry.<br><br>

My colleagues were talking behind my back.<br>
Whatever success I had was fake in their eyes.<br><br>

I was working at Liberty Mutual in Boston.<br>
Steps from the home office.<br>
I was the top sales representative in the company at 23.<br><br>
 
I obsessed over the chatter.<br>
I obsessed over proving them wrong.<br>
I obsessed over a leaderboard.<br><br>
 
I was the top sales representative again at 24.<br><br>
 
More chatter.<br>
More assumptions.<br>
More leaderboards.<br><br>
 
At 25 I was fed up.<br>
At 26 I left.<br><br>

I found entrepreneurship.<br>
Entrepreneurship became a personal growth engine.<br><br>
 
In my 30s, I know I'm not the best.<br><br>

There are correct and incorrect decisions.<br>
I make both on a daily basis.<br><br>

Incorrect decisions at large companies lead to meetings.<br>
With the Bobs.<br>
To let you know it was an incorrect decision.<br><br>

Correct decisions at large companies lead to larger goals.<br>
Bigger leaderboards to climb.<br>
To let you know there's another battle to win.<br><br>

When you're an entrepreneur, correct and incorrect decisions matter.<br>
To you.<br>
To the people that are on a mission with you.<br>
But not to the Bobs.<br>
They don't exist.<br>
Nor do the leaderboards.<br><br>

There's just decisions.<br><br>

Go make one today.<br>

				My Dad was proud to be a small business owner.<br><br>
 
He wouldn't talk about it.<br><br>
 
It wasn’t a topic of conversation.<br>
It was just a part of him.<br><br>

He was excited to see his business card.<br>
He was excited to see his ad in the Yellow Pages.<br><br>

When we took family vacations, we had to stop at the office.<br>
On the way home.<br>
After a long flight.<br>
When no one wants to stop at the office.<br><br>

He had to get the mail.<br>
He had to check out his office.<br><br>

I can imagine what that must've felt like for him.<br>
Alone.<br>
In his office.<br>
Turning on the lights. <br>
Feeling the hum of the machines.<br>
Enjoying a silent moment after a busy vacation.<br>
Getting ready for the chaos of tomorrow.<br><br>

I can imagine his grin.<br>
I can imagine his laughter.<br>
By himself.<br>
As he shut off the light.<br><br>

He loved being a small business owner.<br>
It was his gift to the world.<br>
And to his friends.<br><br>

Most of all, it was a gift to me.<br>
I loved watching him enjoy his work.<br><br>

Yesterday I met my new mentee.<br><br>
 
He’s a Sophomore in the School of Business at UConn.<br><br>
 
The first conversation with undergraduates always feels like a bad networking event.<br>
I try to cut through the awkwardness.<br>
I try to pepper them with questions about their social life.<br>
Dorm life.<br>
Family life.<br>
What kind of food they like.<br>
Anything to get them to open up.<br><br>
 
After a few minutes he started talking about his Dad.<br>
The pressure he felt from him to be successful.<br>
The pressure he felt to get the right grades.<br>
To be part of the right big company after school.<br><br>
 
His first job had to be with a big company.<br>
Because that’s what his Dad did too.<br><br>
 
This kid is witty.<br>
He’s funny.<br>
He’s driven.<br>
He cares about people.<br><br>
 
His Mom and Dad won the child lottery.<br>
Yet he feels completely beaten down.<br>
He’s comparing himself to family friends that are successful.<br><br>
 
He’s a sophomore.<br>
The only thing I was thinking about at his age was living off-campus.<br>
I didn’t care about where I worked after school.<br>
I cared about having enough money for pizza after the bars.<br>
I cared about meeting new people.<br>
Staying out all night.<br>
Making memories.<br><br>
 
The pressure on this kid may create a diamond.<br>
It also may create regret.<br><br>
 
I’ve been a mentor at UConn for seven years.<br>
I’ve learned more about myself than the students.<br>
They are helping me be a better parent.<br>
A better human being.<br><br>
 
Sometimes when you try to give you are the one that receives.<br>

				People are not curious about you.<br><br>

They are curious about themselves.<br><br>
 
Most people ask questions when they know the answer.<br>
Or have an opinion about the answer.<br><br>

I make this mistake often.<br>
I'll ask a question.<br>
Right after I ask I say to myself:<br><br>

"I really don't care about the answer."<br><br>
 
The special people in your life ask real questions.<br>
Questions that make you pause.<br>

My Dad rarely talked about the beginning.<br><br>
 
The early days of Steven Gould Financial Strategies.<br>
Before he had hundreds of clients.<br>
Before he had employees.<br><br>
 
When the bills were tight.<br>
When tough decisions were made.<br>
When the chaos happened.<br><br>

I tried to relate.<br><br>

I chatted about the first sale I made at G&N Insurance.<br>
I waited for him to compare.<br>
He never did.<br><br>
 
I chatted about the first few months of opening our company.<br>
I waited for him to compare.<br>
He never did.<br><br>
 
It took me a long time to realize he was listening.<br>
Asking questions.<br>
Laughing in the moment.<br><br>
 
His past was a place of reference.<br>
Not a place to compare.<br>

				It finally happened.<br><br>

I missed a 6am delivery.<br>
After 310 days in a row.<br><br>

My routine was built to prevent failure.<br><br>

I have an alarm that goes off at 9:30pm.<br>
The reminder says: Check the Daily Musings.<br><br>

It goes off.<br>
I login to Mailchimp.<br>
I make edits.<br><br>

I schedule the newsletter to be delivered to you at 6:00am the next day.<br><br>

Sunday, I made a mistake.<br>
I'd love to blame Mailchimp.<br>
I think they have a little more experience than me though.<br><br>

I woke up at 7:10am.<br>
The Fury vs. Wilder fight didn't end until around 12:40am.<br>
The kiddos rewarded us with an extra hour of sleep.<br><br>

I brushed my teeth.<br>
Chatted with Emma and Mason.<br>
Then I opened my phone to double-check the Daily Musings delivery.<br><br>

I refreshed my email inbox.<br>
Again.<br>
Again.<br>
Nothing.<br><br>

I panicked.<br><br>

I logged into Mailchimp and hit send.<br>
At 7:25am you got your Daily Musing.<br><br>

Your day didn't change.<br>
You probably didn't even notice.<br><br>

That's a good thing.<br><br>

Focus on what you're doing.<br>
This is your reminder.<br>
No one else has time to focus on you.<br>

				We got a 1-star review on Google in 2020.<br><br>

It wasn't our first.<br>
It won't be our last.<br>
We make mistakes.<br><br>

This one was different.<br>
It was from a competitor.<br><br>

An insurance agency owner in Western, Massachusetts.<br>
That I’d never met.<br>
That wasn’t a client.<br><br>
 
I was furious.<br>
I called the guy before I saw my Dad.<br>
The call went about as you’d expect…<br><br>
 
He told me we stole a client from his business.<br>
Then he said a few choice words about our agency.<br>
And hung up.<br><br>

I saw my Dad a few hours later.<br>
I told him the story.<br><br>
 
My Dad roared with laughter.<br><br>

“I’m sorry Dad, I shouldn’t waste your time.<br>
Let’s talk about something else.”<br><br>
 
He face fell.<br>
The smile was gone.<br>
Laughter distant.<br><br>
 
“Zack.<br>
This is the important stuff.<br>
This is the stuff you haven’t learned yet.<br>
There will be another guy like him next month.<br>
And the month after that.<br>
But they mean nothing.<br>
An enemy in your trust circle is dangerous.<br>
These people are not in your trust circle.<br>
Move on, Young Grasshoppah."<br><br>
 
My Dad had a way of cutting through the BS.<br><br>

I could use him right now.<br>
I could use him always.<br>

Mason and Emma are experiencing a lot of “firsts” lately.<br><br>
 
This weekend was one for Mason and his football team.<br><br>
 
When we got to the field, he saw the balloons.<br>
His face lit up.<br>
He knew it was a special day.<br><br>
 
It was homecoming.<br>
Even at six years old, homecoming matters.<br><br>
 
They got to run out of a tunnel.<br>
Onto the field.<br>
With pump up music while their name was called.<br><br>
 
So. Cool.<br><br>
 
I pulled out my camera to take videos and pictures.<br>
I zoomed in.<br>
And I sighed.<br><br>
 
It looked terrible on my camera.<br>
Even with a decent iPhone it looked pixilated.<br>
 
I decided to put my phone to the side.<br><br>
 
I kicked myself later that night for not getting some videos.<br>
I talked to Mase about it.<br><br>
 
“Mase, Dad didn’t get any pictures of the balloons.<br>
Sorry bud.”<br><br>
 
Mason was playing with his LEGOs before bed.<br>
He was in an intense battle.<br>
He didn’t look up.<br>
He just said:<br><br>
 
“Did you hear the song they played, Dad?<br>
It was awesome.”<br><br>
 
I did.<br>
And that’s what mattered.<br><br>

It was Thunderstruck by AC/DC.<br>
His favorite song.<br>

				I believe we have one shot at this game<br><br>

I believe I’m following my heart.<br>
I also believe people sway my internal ideas.<br><br>
 
I found myself looking up Bora Bora vacations last night.<br>
I was looking at hotels.<br>
How long the flight would take.<br>
What types of sharks were in the water.<br><br>
 
My friend is there.<br>
She posted a story of the beautiful water.<br>
I didn’t even know Bora Bora existed until I saw it on Instagram.<br><br>

I stopped after a few minutes and laughed at myself.<br><br>
 
They are living their life, I need to live mine.<br><br>
 
I have my own problems to tackle.<br>
Dreams to chase.<br><br>
 
We may as well do whatever we want.<br><br>
 
No one is judging.<br>
They are too busy judging themselves.<br><br>
 
I may never see Bora Bora.<br>
It doesn't matter.<br><br>
 
I need to get back to Europe first.<br>
I need to see Auschwitz.<br><br>

The pictures may not make it to Instagram.<br>
There will be no beach.<br><br>

It's for my soul.<br>
It's for my Dad.<br><br>

It’s 3:47am.<br><br>
 
In my early 20s, I’d be watching SportsCenter.<br>
Checking out the highlights from the sports games I missed.<br>
Making some food.<br><br>
 
In my mid-20s, I’d be catching up on work.<br>
Quoting insurance plans.<br>
Writing emails to my business partner Matt about our latest idea.<br><br>
 
In my early 30s, I’d be holding Mason or Emma.<br>
Whispering to myself: “This will be worth it…”<br>
Dreaming of getting sleep.<br><br>
 
Now, I’m 37.<br>
What happened during the game doesn’t matter.<br>
Work can wait.<br>
The kids are in bed.<br><br>
 
My window is open and the cold October air is softly entering the room.<br>
I have a large glass of water and an empty page.<br><br>
 
I’m calm.<br>
This is where I should be today, at 3:47am.<br><br>
 
My mind is buzzing.<br>
I’m letting it wander onto the page.<br>
A quiet mind is a scary thought.<br><br>
 
If you mind is hungry, feed it.<br>

I introduce myself as Zack.<br>
Not Zack Gould.<br><br>

It eliminates the relation game.<br>
The inevitable conversation:<br><br>
 
“I’ve met ___ Gould.<br>
Are you related to them?”<br><br>
 
Nope.<br>
 
“There are a lot of Goulds in Boston.<br>
Did you grow up there??”<br><br>
 
Nope.<br>
 
Last month it made someone uncomfortable.<br>
They introduced themselves with their first and last name.<br>
I introduced myself back as Zack.<br><br>
 
Then they made a gesture with their hand.<br>
The “please continue…” kind of gesture.<br>
So, I did.<br>
I said I worked at G&N Insurance.<br><br>
 
He laughed and said:<br>
“Son, your last name is not G&N Insurance.<br>
You need to introduce yourself with your last name next time."<br><br>

Fast forward a few weeks…<br>
He’s become a client of G&N Insurance.<br><br>

I wonder if that would’ve happened if I said “Zack Gould”.<br><br>
 
It may have been the end of our discussion.<br>
He may have said, “Nice to meet you.”<br>
That would be the end of our interaction.<br>
Forever.<br><br>
 
You get one chance to introduce yourself.<br>
Say something that matters.<br><br>

My last name doesn’t matter in a group setting.<br>
My first name and a genuine smile matter more than my last name.<br>

Business planning began in the Fall of 2008.<br>
We opened the doors in 2010.<br><br>
 
Our biggest fear wasn’t failure.<br>
Our biggest fear was getting caught in the act of planning.<br><br>
 
And it happened in 2009.<br><br>
 
We agreed to meet at 4am on a Sunday at Matt's office in 2009.<br>
We thought we’d strategize for a few hours.<br>
Then play golf around 9am.<br><br>
 
We had printed about 300 pages of documents.<br>
Filled three or four whiteboards with ideas.<br>
The office smelled like toner and markers.<br><br>

We were just about done.<br><br>
 
Then Tony walked in.<br>
He was stunned.<br>
We stared at each other for a second…<br><br>
 
“What the hell are you guys doing here?<br>
Zack… don’t you work in Boston?”<br><br>
 
We had a few minutes of awkward conversation.<br>
Then we left.<br><br>
 
The worst thing that could possibly happen, happened.<br>
Tony knew.<br>
That meant Matt’s boss would know.<br><br>
 
We feared for the worst.<br>
But it never came.<br>
Because Tony was leaving too.<br>
He was going to the office to plan his exit.<br><br>
 
My worst fears rarely happen outside of my own head.<br><br>

Go Monday,<br>

Every few weeks I make the same mistake.<br><br>

An innocent one.<br>
But a mistake nonetheless.<br><br>

I forget to tell people where I'm trying to go.<br>
Why we're here.<br>
Why it matters.<br><br>

In business, I've lost employees.<br>
I've lost key sales.<br>
I've lost important customers.<br><br>

In my personal life, I've lost friends.<br>
I've made my kids cry.<br>
I've made KG upset.<br><br>

All because I'm trying to go somewhere.<br>
And no one knows why.<br>
And no one knows where.<br><br>

Only I do.<br><br>

Yesterday I received a few emails from subscribers of The Daily Musings.<br>
They all asked a similar question:<br><br>

Why are you doing this? <br>
What's the goal?<br><br>

It's an important question.<br>
And an answer I need to provide on a more frequent basis.<br><br>

When my Dad died, I lost the person I relied on.<br><br>

When I needed to vent.<br>
When I felt anger.<br>
When I felt sadness.<br><br>

My Dad was the person that was able to hear what I wasn't saying.<br>
Not only what I was saying.<br><br>

I remember one of our last conversations.<br>
He was slumped over in his chair.<br>
He could barely hold his head up anymore.<br><br>

I was holding his putter in his room.<br>
Twirling it while I was talking.<br>
Making putts with the golf balls the lied around the room.<br><br>

He looked up at me and said:<br>
"Son, I can't focus on what you're saying when you're doing that.<br><br>

That was my Dad.<br>
He wanted to focus so badly even at the end.<br><br>

I lost that person in August of 2020.<br><br>

I had to make a choice when he died.<br>
Find a new person.<br>
Or continue our conversations in his memory.<br><br>

Shannon Hoon from Blind Melon said it best:<br><br>

But I know we can't all stay here forever<br>
So I'm gonna write my words on the face of today.<br><br>

I'm writing my words.<br>

Emma was the girl that wouldn’t go on the soccer field.<br><br>
 
She fought us at home.<br>
Begged us not to go to the field.<br><br>
 
She complained that her shoes were too small.<br>
Her shin guards were too tight.<br>
Her soccer jersey was too big.<br><br>
 
One day KG  told her to wear whatever she wanted.<br><br>

She dressed up in polka dot pants and a polka dot shirt.<br>
She looked like a dog.<br><br>
 
She was yelling “Woof Woof!” around the house before she left.<br>
I thought we were screwed.<br><br>
 
That’s the day everything changed.<br><br>
 
Emma loves soccer now.<br><br>
 
She shows up looking like she’s going to a beauty pageant.<br><br>
 
She’s decked out in her newest outfit.<br>
White shoes.<br>
Makeup on.<br>
Her hair is perfect.<br><br>
 
She’ll score a few goals.<br>
She won’t let anyone from the other team score a goal.<br>
She's fast.<br><br>
 
Mason and I watched her today.<br><br>
 
It was the first time Mason was able to see her in action.<br><br>
 
He joked about her outfit.<br>
He laughed when she whiffed at a ball.<br><br>
 
Then he was quiet when she stole the ball from a bigger boy.<br>
He gave a soft clap when she ran fast across the field.<br>
Then he started screaming for her when she scored her goal.<br><br>
 
He knew what I knew in that moment.<br><br>
 
Emma is the real deal.<br>
You can’t judge her by her outfit.<br><br>

She’s ready for the field and the celebration dinner after.<br>

				Gin Rummy was our family game.<br><br>
 
I played it often.<br>
Against my grandfather.<br>
Against my Mom.<br>
Against my Dad.<br><br>
 
It’s a game that combines strategy and luck.<br>
Patience and memory.<br><br>
 
It’s perfect.<br><br>
 
Last night KG asked me if I wanted to play a card game.<br>
We haven’t played cards in a long time.<br><br>

We've never played Gin Rummy.<br><br>
 
KG decided to try it out.<br>
She played once or twice as a kid but needed a reminder of the rules.<br><br>
 
I briefly explained the rules.<br>
Then I dove deep into the strategy behind defense vs. offense.<br>
She rolled her eyes after a few sentences:<br><br>
 
“Zack, I don’t care about your cards.<br>
I care about my cards.”<br><br>
 
I laughed.<br>
I thought we’d play two or three hands before she gave up.<br><br>
 
We ended up playing the entire game.<br>
She kicked my ass.<br><br>
 
I took it seriously.<br>
I used the strategy my grandfather taught me.<br><br>
 
I would’ve been better off singing Sinatra.<br>
Enjoy a glass of tequila.<br>
Laughing at stories from the day.<br><br>
 
That’s what KG did.<br>
She sang and laughed her way to victory.<br><br>

"I did it my way..."<br>

My Dad had an electric tie rack.<br><br>
 
I thought it was amazing.<br>
He could press a button and the ties would circle around.<br>
It looked like he had over a hundred ties.<br><br>
 
I’d sneak into his closet when he was at work.<br>
Hit the button and pretend I was choosing which tie to wear.<br>
Grab the shiniest one and try to tie it.<br><br>
 
I ruined the majority of his ties.<br>
I didn't get in trouble.<br>
He just bought new ties.<br><br>

So, I kept doing it.<br>
For as long as I can remember.<br><br>
 
Yesterday I was cleaning out my closet for Fall.<br>
I saw my tie rack.<br>
I laughed and said to KG:<br><br>

“I can’t believe I even have a tie rack anymore.”<br><br>
 
Then I saw my ties.<br>
They were tied to the shelves.<br>
To other clothes.<br><br>
 
It looked like a giant spiderweb.<br><br>
 
Only four ties were left unharmed.<br>
Like father like son.<br>
He won't get in trouble either.<br><br>

I like his imagination.<br><br>

Happy Pizza Friday,<br>

We laughed at the COVID outfit.<br><br>
 
Pressed shirt and tie on the top.<br>
Sweatpants on the bottom.<br><br>
 
Social media was full of examples.<br>
From celebrities.<br>
To your colleagues.<br><br>
 
Everyone knew you weren’t in a full suit.<br><br>
 
Yet, this shows up everywhere.<br><br>
 
We get our kids dressed up in fancy clothes for the pictures.<br>
We clean the basement and put away all the toys for a playdate.<br><br>
 
We’re always wearing shirts and ties on top.<br>
When the reality is we’re in sweatpants.<br><br>
 
The camera only shows part of your image.<br>
Your true friends see the entire picture.<br><br>
 
Your true friends prefer your sweatshirt on top.<br>

I parked in a handicap spot last week.<br><br>
 
I try to not use words like “ever” and “never”.<br>
But I can say confidently that I’ve never parked in a handicap spot before.<br><br>
 
My cousin needs a handicap spot.<br>
When you spend time with my cousin you realize the importance of the handicap spot.<br>
That’s the end of your internal debate to park in a handicap spot.<br>
Even for a second while you grab something inside a store.<br><br>
 
I was circling a coffee shop in Needham to meet my friend Christina.<br>
Each parking spot was taken or there was a fire hydrant.<br><br>
 
Then, the brake lights of a parked car turned on to my right.<br>
It’s such a beautiful feeling.<br>
Right spot, right time.<br><br>
 
I let the person leave and parallel parked in the spot.<br><br>
 
After the coffee, I walked back to my car and saw the ticket.<br>
The paper read: “Handicap Violation”.<br><br>
 
No way…<br>
I’d never…<br><br>
 
I couldn’t find a handicap emblem on the ground.<br>
No indication on the parking meter.<br><br>
 
Then I saw it…<br>
10 yards to the right of the parking spot.<br>
Across the sidewalk.<br>
Knocked over.<br>
On the ground.<br>
Facing the sky.<br>
A handicap sign.<br><br>
 
It was half covered in leaves and dirt.<br>
It looked like it had been knocked over for a few weeks.<br>
If you were local to the area, you’d know.<br>
If you were visiting, you wouldn’t see it.<br><br>
 
I slumped my shoulders in disgust.<br>
I was pissed at myself.<br><br>
 
I got back in the car and looked at the ticket.<br>
To my surprise, it was just a warning.<br><br>
 
As I drove home, I thought of the warning vs. the ticket.<br>
I wondered why the police officer gave me a warning.<br>
He had every right to give me a ticket.<br><br>
 
For me, the internal damage was done.<br>
Whether I had to pay a fine or not was irrelevant.<br><br>
 
A ticket won’t change actions.<br>
You either believe your wrong or you don’t.<br>

I think I can fix most businesses.<br><br>
 
I eat at the restaurant.<br>
Shop at the store.<br>
One time.<br>
And think I know their problems.<br><br>
 
Better yet, I’m sure I know their problems.<br><br>
 
Our friends Amanda and Joe own Kith and Kin in Hudson, Massachusetts.<br>
The restaurant is open for brunch through dinner.<br>
Every day.<br><br>
 
I thought that was a problem.<br><br>

How can they be good at all meals?<br>
Why not focus a little more on the quality of their dinner service?<br>
There’s a diner across the street.<br>
Why compete with them for breakfast??<br><br>
 
I considered telling them.<br>
Instead, KG and I finished our meal with the kiddos and went home.<br><br>
 
I got a text from Joe that night:<br><br>

“ZG! Thanks for coming!<br>
BTW, you left your CC at the table.<br>
Stop by tomorrow and pick it up.”<br><br>
 
I felt like I was 22 again leaving my credit card at Golden Temple in Brookline.<br><br>
 
I drove back the next morning at 9am.<br>
I was frustrated…<br>
I couldn’t find parking. Anywhere.<br><br>
 
I parked two streets over and walked to the restaurant.<br>
The bar was 2-people-deep.<br>
Every table was full.<br>
There was a line outside.<br><br>
 
For breakfast.<br>
The meal I wanted to tell them to avoid.<br><br>
 
Kith and Kin is doing just fine without me.<br>
Most businesses are doing just fine without me too.<br><br>

Go Monday,<br>

One of my Dad’s last sentences to me was:<br>
“You gotta stop taking life so seriously…”<br><br>
 
It’s something he said to me often.<br><br>
 
Conceptually, it makes sense.<br>
Yet, I struggle with his last words.<br><br>
 
I took a golf lesson a little while ago.<br><br>
 
I’m an above-average golfer.<br>
Some days I make a few birdies.<br>
Some days I can’t hit the center of the clubface.<br><br>
 
The instructor asked me what my goals were.<br>
I told him I wanted to be a scratch golfer.<br><br>
 
He didn’t laugh.<br>
He didn’t argue.<br>
He said:<br>
“OK. Hit a couple of shots and let’s see what’s going on.”<br><br>
 
I took two swings with a pitching wedge.<br>
Both were pured.<br>
Within 20 feet of the flag.<br><br>
 
I turned around expecting a compliment.<br>
I didn’t get one.<br>
I got a long, loud laugh.<br>
When he caught his breath, he said:<br><br>
 
“Son.<br>
You look like you’re trying to squeeze the life out of that golf club.<br>
What the hell is the matter with you?<br>
How are you going to become a scratch golfer being that tense?”<br><br>
 
He was right.<br>
Just like my Dad said:<br>
“You gotta stop taking life so seriously…”<br><br>
 
I drove home that day without music.<br>
Without an Audible book or a podcast.<br>
Just with my thoughts.<br><br>
 
My Dad’s last words to me have a way of reappearing.<br>
Everywhere I go.<br>
That’s what good advice should do.<br>

Today I turn 38.<br><br>
 
I used to think I’d die around age 70.<br>
That’s what my genes say.<br>
My Dad and his Dad died at a similar age.<br><br>
 
Now, I think there’s a chance I die tomorrow.<br><br>
 
That’s my biggest life lesson from 37.<br>
My Dad’s death ripped a hole in my heart.<br>
It made me realize that tomorrow is just a word.<br><br>
 
It isn’t a day until I open my eyes.<br><br>
 
I’m happy.<br>
I’m healthy.<br><br>

I’m the Dad today that I thought I could become.<br>
I’m the husband today that I thought I could become.<br><br>
 
I have many more steps to take.<br>
In no particular order, here’s what I’m thinking about:<br><br>
 
-Getting better at making coffee.<br>
-Becoming a scratch golfer.<br>
-Taking a break from alcohol.<br>
-Traveling somewhere for longer than a week.<br>
-Going on a solo trip with Emma.<br><br>
 
Here’s to another day.<br><br>
 
Love you all,<br>

				I’d make that phone call.<br><br>
 
To the referral partner.<br>
To tell them we made a mistake.<br>
To inform them that our mistake will cost them a sale.<br><br>
 
To the client.<br>
To tell them that their claim was not covered.<br>
To inform them that they’d have to pay out of pocket for their claim.<br><br>
 
To the person that left a negative review online.<br>
To listen to their story.<br>
To tell them they are right to feel angry.<br><br>
 
I’d make the phone call that gave me goose bumps.<br><br>
 
I wouldn’t put it off to a convenient time of the day.<br>
I’d do it now.<br><br>
 
The 1,000th time I did it was as hard as the first time.<br>
It never got easier to make the tough phone call.<br>
It just became a routine.<br><br>
 
I did the same thing before each call.<br><br>
 
I’d grab my grandfather’s putter.<br>
Feel the weight of the mallet at the bottom.<br>
Look at the age of the wood.<br>
Smile.<br><br>
 
Take a few imaginary strokes with the putter.<br><br>
 
Start dialing.<br><br>
 
Find your putter and make the call.<br>

For a while I couldn’t listen to Bob Seger.<br><br>
 
It brought back memories of being in my Dad’s car.<br>
Singing on the way home from Mt. Pleasant Country Club.<br><br>
 
Dreaming of driving on my own instead of sitting in the passenger seat.<br>
Dreaming of being an adult.<br><br>
 
After a few months, I gave in.<br>
I decided to listen to the Bob’s Greatest Hits album on a drive to Westport.<br>
It opens with Roll Me Away.<br>
The chorus is the perfect part to sing while you’re driving:<br><br>
 
Roll, roll me away<br>
Won't you roll me away tonight<br>
I too am lost, I feel double-crossed<br>
And I'm sick of what's wrong and what's right<br><br>
 
I sung it loud by myself and let the tears flow.<br>
When the song finished, I pulled the car to the side of the road.<br>
I looked for a sign, for something that would remind me of my Dad.<br><br>
 
There was nothing there.<br>
There was no magical tree, bush or cloud.<br>
I got back in my car.<br>
Turned up the volume and kept listening to Bob Seger.<br><br>
 
After a few more songs I realized why there was no sign.<br><br>

The sign was the album.<br>
The sign was the moment.<br>
I didn’t need affirmation.<br>
I was in the moment.<br><br>
 
What I was looking for was already around me.<br>

Biggie summed it up best:<br><br>
 
“It's like the more money we come across<br>
The more problems we see.”<br><br>
 
Cash is oxygen.<br>
Money provides access.<br>
Life is easier with than without money.<br><br>
 
Yet, being known as someone that has money isn’t a positive attribute.<br>
It’s seen as a negative.<br><br>
 
Being successful is the goal, but when you get there, it creates anxiety.<br><br>
 
That’s why Lou Holtz and others recommend being viewed as significant.<br><br>
 
“But when you are significant is when you help other people be successful.<br>
That lasts many a lifetime.”<br><br>
 
More money does make more problems.<br>
More success does make more problems.<br><br>
 
More significance is the goal.<br>

I taught Mason how to multiply yesterday.<br><br>

He's been asking me to teach him.<br>
I have no idea how to teach a 6-year-old mathematics.<br><br>
 
So, I went to YouTube.<br>
I watched a short video with a Mom and her daughter.<br>
I took some notes and gave it a shot.<br><br>

We started by defining multiplication .<br><br>
 
I gave him two sets of two M&Ms.<br>
Then three sets.<br>
Then four sets.<br><br>
 
We chatted about how multiplication works.<br>
What happens to numbers when you multiply them.<br><br>
 
Multiplication isn’t “two times two”.<br>
Multiplication is “two, two times.”<br><br>
 
We spent five minutes on the principles.<br>
Then we started learning techniques.<br><br>
 
The next night he was in his bedroom doing 12X8 by himself.<br>
7x13<br>
And so on…<br><br>

He's asked for multiplication problems every night since our lesson.<br><br>
 
He understood the principles first.<br>
Then we focused on the techniques.<br><br>
 
YouTube saved the day, again.<br>

My 38th year started in a different way than any other year.<br><br>
 
The morning after my birthday I got in my car.<br>
I set the destination for New York City.<br>
Dinner with my uncle and aunt were my only plans.<br><br>
 
After a night in the city, I got back in my car.<br>
I set the destination for Greenwich, Connecticut.<br>
Partying with my friends Sarin, Nick and Joe were my only plans.<br><br>
 
My first solo trip to New York City to see my uncle and aunt.<br>
Ever.<br><br>
 
Sarin, Nick, Joe and I haven’t hung out since college in 2006.<br><br>
 
I have no group pictures from the two days together.<br>
I have nothing to post on social media about.<br><br>
 
The only evidence I have from the trip are two books from my uncle.<br>
A date set in the Spring of 2022 to get together again with my college friends.<br>
That’s all I need.<br><br>

Don’t wait until it’s too late.<br>
Travel a long way to have one dinner.<br>
Take the drive to see your friends.<br><br>
 
Life will give you reasons you shouldn’t make the time.<br><br>
 
I’m glad I paused my inner voice last week.<br>
The voice of reason can wait another day.<br><br>
 
38 is looking good so far.<br>

In the Winter of 2004 I got my first real internship.<br><br>
 
It was with Direct Dialog Inc.<br>
A marketing agency for luxury brands in travel and sports.<br><br>
 
The owner, Olivier, was the uncle of a friend of mine in college.<br><br>
 
I thought Olivier was rich.<br><br>
 
He drove the fanciest car I’d ever seen.<br>
He owned a boat.<br>
He wore expensive clothes.<br>
He was an entrepreneur.<br><br>
 
He checked all the boxes.<br>
I didn’t want to screw this internship up.<br>
I wanted to impress him at all costs.<br>
I wanted to earn his recommendation in the future.<br><br>
 
The internship was in Norwalk, CT.<br>
I was living in Central Massachusetts over Winter break.<br>
That’s 150 miles.<br>
Each way.<br><br>
 
I drove there three days a week.<br>
I was committed to learning sales and marketing.<br><br>
 
Half-way through my internship, Olivier got the news:<br>
The New Jersey Devils agreed to meet with him.<br>
To inquire about his services.<br>
To potentially use his business.<br><br>
 
For a small company, this is as big as it gets.<br><br>
 
The meeting was at their stadium.<br>
I was pumped.<br>
I had to be there.<br><br>
 
We agreed to drive together in his car to the meeting.<br><br>

Mid-way through the drive, we decided to take a break.<br>
We pulled over for a coffee at a gas station.<br>
I jumped out of the car before the car was even in park.<br><br>
 
“I’ll pump the gas for you, Olivier!”<br><br>
 
It took me two minutes to figure out how to open the gas cap.<br>
There were levers and buttons I had never seen before.<br>
I was driving a beaten up Oldsmobile.<br><br>
 
This car was different.<br><br>
 
I started fueling the vehicle, but the meter wasn’t moving.<br>
I was sure I was pressing the lever hard enough.<br>
“Stupid expensive cars…”<br><br>
 
Olivier came back out of the coffee shop.<br><br>
 
“Zack! Still fueling?! What’s the matter??”<br><br>
 
I looked up, and that’s when it happened.<br>
The gas sprayed everywhere.<br>
All over his car.<br>
All over my suit.<br>
All over the ground.<br><br>
 
Everything was soaked.<br><br>
 
The meeting was in 13 minutes.<br>
I remember that because we had no time to debate what to do.<br><br>
 
We drove to the meeting.<br><br>
 
I told him I didn’t need to go in.<br>
He could go solo.<br><br>
 
He laughed.<br>
Took a long look at me and said:<br><br>
 
“Zack, this is perfect.<br>
Now I have something to talk about.”<br><br>
 
Minutes later, the executive team from the New Jersey Devils was in tears.<br>
They couldn’t control their laughter.<br>
Olivier spent more time talking about my mistake than his services.<br><br>
 
Hours later, he got the deal signed.<br><br>
 
I learned more about sales that day than any class I attended at UConn.<br>

We are terrible predictors of the future.<br><br>
 
Many of my friends told me they’d never get married.<br>
Many of my friends told me they’d never have kids.<br><br>
 
I said I’d never live in Southborough.<br>
I grew up in Southborough.<br>
It was a fate worse than death to move back to Southborough.<br><br>
 
Here I am.<br>
In Southborough.<br><br>
 
I knew I’d have a Chocolate Labrador.<br>
I loved the breed.<br>
The minute I could afford a dog, I’d have one.<br><br>
 
Here I am.<br>
With two Wheaten Terriers.<br><br>
 
Predicting the future doesn’t work.<br>
Remembering the past is more valuable.<br><br>
 
Aiming for better.<br>

Mason crushed my toe last week.<br><br>
 
The toe that gives my pain with each step.<br>
The toe that has a permanent grape tomato color.<br><br>
 
We were playing soccer in the basement.<br>
He tried to slide tackle me.<br>
He bent my toe back instead.<br><br>
 
I doubled over in pain.<br>
He proceeded to score the goal.<br>
Do a victory lap.<br><br>
 
Then he came back and checked on me.<br><br>

“What an ass” I thought.<br>
Then again, I’d do the same thing.<br>
It’s what I’m teaching him to do.<br><br>
 
There was no whistle.<br><br>
 
The first thing he said was:<br>
“Dad, did you ever hurt your toe when you traveled the world?”<br><br>
 
Mason refers to my work at BobbleOn as traveling the world.<br><br>
 
BobbleOn was a consulting company we opened.<br>
To help other insurance agencies achieve their vision.<br>
Unify their teams.<br>
Create more revenue.<br><br>
 
It worked.<br>
That was also the problem.<br><br>
 
I was on a plane at least once a week for about a year.<br>
It took a toll on my kids, and KG.<br><br>
 
I told him I didn’t hurt my toe traveling.<br><br>
 
His immediate reply:<br>
“I don’t think I’d hurt my toe when I travel the world either.<br>
OK, it’s 10 points for me.<br>
3 points for you.<br>
Your ball.”<br><br>
 
I used to ask Mason why he asked such random questions.<br>
Now I laugh.<br>
It’s just who he is.<br>

If you could witness one part of history….<br><br>
 
What would it be?<br>
Why?<br><br>
 
The three that come to my mind first are:<br>
The dinosaurs.<br>
The building of the pyramids.<br>
The signing of the Declaration of Independence.<br><br>
 
If I had to choose, it’d be the building of the pyramids.<br><br>
 
I’ve watched documentaries.<br>
I’ve heard the theories.<br><br>
 
I want to see the actual design.<br>
The failures.<br>
The re-design.<br>
The grind to build them.<br>
The late nights.<br>
The celebration when they were completed.<br>
The way they used the pyramids after.<br><br>
 
I’m fascinated by the pyramids.<br>
I wish I could be a fly on the wall to watch the process.<br><br>

Happy Pizza Friday,<br>

“Happy Pizza Friday, ZG!<br>
…even though I’m not totally sure what that means…”<br><br>
 
I’ve received this email more times than I can count.<br>
It’s time to talk about Pizza Friday.<br><br>
 
I love pizza.<br>
Always have.<br>
I’m not a big fan of Chicago-style pizza.<br>
Or Greek-style.<br><br>
 
Traditional Italian pizza.<br>
Any type of toppings.<br><br>
 
KG and I also enjoy entertaining.<br><br>
 
Good pizza and entertaining slowed down when the kids were under two years old.<br>
We decided to take it into our own hands.<br><br>
 
We would order a bunch of pizza.<br>
Or make the pizza at home.<br>
Text a few parents with younger kids.<br><br>
 
The kids ate some pizza and played with toys.<br>
The parents hung out and had some time without kids draped all over them.<br><br>
 
It became a weekly activity.<br>
It became our Friday night.<br>
In the years since, we’ve only missed a handful of Pizza Fridays.<br><br>
 
COVID slowed down the get-togethers.<br>
So we took to Zoom.<br>
Then we hired a pizza chef to make pizzas and put them at the end of our driveway.<br><br>
 
It’s become a tradition.<br><br>
 
“Happy Pizza Friday” is our way of connecting with friends and neighbors.<br><br>
 
The more remote we become the more I’m reminded of why we come together.<br>
Pizza has nothing to do with it.<br>
Pizza just came along for the ride.<br><br>
 
KG and I were looking for a reason to celebrate with friends.<br>
Friday is more important than pizza.<br>
Because Friday happens every week.<br>
Because we should celebrate every week.<br>

The kids and I visited my Dad's grave today.The kids and I visited my Dad's grave today.<br><br>

It isn't a rare occurrence.<br>
It also isn't a weekly occurrence.<br><br>

We're fortunate that his grave is in Southborough.<br>
Where we live.<br>
Whenever we drive by his grave we wave.<br><br>

Today we took a right turn and enjoyed a few minutes with him.<br><br>

The second the car is in park, Mason and Emma bolt out of the doors.<br><br>

His gravesite turns into their own personal playground.<br><br>

Today, Emma did handstands.<br>
Cartwheels.<br>
And jumped all over his headstone.<br><br>

Mason showed Papa his "moves" that led to his goal in soccer.<br>
He ripped up the grass around the headstone.<br>
Then he jumped on the headstone with Emma.<br><br>

My Dad's gravesite is a place where I don't discipline our kids.<br><br>

They can do whatever they want.<br>
I treat his gravesite like his house.<br>
Roaring laughter.<br>
Endless smiles.<br><br>

It's his rules.<br>
If he doesn't speak up, keep going.<br><br>

Today, he didn't speak up.<br>
He just smiled.<br>

I have one quote on my desk.<br><br>
 
It reads:<br>
What will you wish you spent time on today?<br><br>
 
It makes me leave my desk.<br>
Walk the kids to the bus stop.<br>
Play soccer with them in the basement.<br>
Enjoy a glass of wine with KG.<br>
Read a book.<br>
Write.<br>
Drink water.<br>
Work out in the garage.<br><br>
 
I don’t need a motivational quote on my desk to work.<br>
I’m at my desk.<br>
I’m here because I’m ready to work.<br><br>

The quote is to remind me not to waste time working.<br>
Get it done.<br>
On time.<br>
As advertised.<br>
And move on.<br><br>
 
Motivation isn’t necessary when you’re already there.<br><br>

Go Monday,<br>

The tooth fairy visited Mason yesterday.<br><br>
 
She gave him $5.<br>
Because it was the only dollar bill KG and I had between us.<br><br>
 
Mason was pumped.<br><br>
 
I’d be pumped too.<br>
Imagine waking up with $5 under your pillow on a Saturday.<br>
What a great way to start the day.<br><br>
 
Mason put the $5 in his wallet.<br>
He brought his wallet to his soccer practice.<br>
KG asked why.<br>
His response is classic:<br><br>
 
“You always forget your wallet.<br>
I want to buy ice cream.<br>
Now I can buy the ice cream.”<br><br>
 
We always bring our wallets.<br>
But it’s a perfect excuse to not buy ice cream.<br>
No wallet. No cash.<br><br>
 
Mason figured out his own solution.<br>
Because he really, really wanted the ice cream.<br>
He found a way.<br><br>
 
Someone in your office will have an issue with their phone this month.<br>
Someone in your office will have a computer issue at work this month.<br><br>
 
Expectations will be missed.<br>
Deadlines will be ignored.<br>
The only person that actually suffers is the client.<br>
Their experience sucks.<br><br>
 
It isn’t because your colleague is a bad person.<br>
It’s because they don’t really, really want to get the job done.<br>
Or else, they’d find a way.<br><br>
 
There is a way to get-around troubles with your work phone.<br>
There is a way to get-around troubles with your computer at work.<br><br>
 
There’s always a way.<br>
Or else it’s the end.<br><br>
 
Maybe your colleague is trying to tell you it’s the end.<br>

			  I used to look down on Stoicism.<br><br>
 
			  I read the books.<br>
			  …but I didn’t really read them.<br><br>

			  I looked at the Stoics as people that lived without feelings.<br>

I love buying vehicles.<br><br>
 
It’s a process.<br>
Like anything else.<br><br>
 
It has ups.<br>
It has downs.<br><br>
 
I’ve watched videos on YouTube about negotiating at the dealership.<br>
The situations they describe rarely happen.<br><br>
 
The dealership won’t waive all costs that are excessive.<br>
No matter how compelling our argument is.<br><br>
 
The “destination fee” sounds bogus.<br>
That doesn’t mean they are going to remove it.<br><br>
 
Car negotiations are won and lost by a basic concept:<br>
Which party cares less.<br><br>
 
I try to remove emotion from the buying experience.<br>
I decline the pastries.<br>
The free coffee.<br>
The waters.<br><br>
 
That’s a gift.<br>
When you receive a gift you feel compelled to reply with a gift.<br><br>
 
I don’t have a specific color in mind.<br>
I don’t have a specific monthly cost.<br>
I don’t have the vehicle yet.<br><br>
 
I care about the total cost of the vehicle.<br>
If they can get it to fit the amount that I desire, we got a deal.<br>
If not, it’s their car.<br>
Hopefully someone else will pay their price.<br><br>
 
With that mindset, I’ve laughed at the cost I’ve paid for vehicles.<br>
I feel like I’ve “won” each negotiation.<br><br>
 
I’ve received the vehicle.<br>
At the cost I’ve desired.<br><br>
 
Negotiations are won or lost based on our level of caring.<br>
Give it a try next time.<br>
Care less.<br><br>
 
The vehicle is not your vehicle, just because you can afford it.<br>
The dealership owns it until they meet your price.<br><br>

The first company newsletter I sent was horrible.<br><br>
 
It violated everything I know about marketing and copywriting.<br><br>
 
I wrote about all of our achievements.<br>
I titled the newsletter “Happy Thanksgiving!!”<br>
I included a poem written by an unknown source (Google).<br>
The call-to-action asked the reader to click a link to send a question to us.<br>
I asked people to forward the email so people could get on our “list”.<br>
There was a random Seinfeld quote inserted on the left side of the page that read:<br>
"When you control the mail, you control information!"-Newman<br><br>
 
Yet, people replied.<br>
So I did it again.<br>
And again.<br>
And again.<br><br>
 
I thought I was a newsletter king.<br>
I got replies.<br>
Must’ve been the humor.<br>
So I included more inside jokes.<br>
More Seinfeld quotes.<br>
Then I got referrals from the newsletter.<br>
Revenue! For jokes!<br>
More Seinfeld quotes.<br>
More inside jokes.<br><br>
 
Then I asked a few clients why they referred people to the newsletter.<br>
All of them said the same thing:<br><br>
 
“I want to get on that list you put in the newsletter.”<br>
I laughed.<br>
“You’re already on the list…<br>
That’s why you’re getting the newsletter!”<br><br>
 
They laughed back.<br>
“No. The list on the right hand side.”<br><br>
 
I had included a “Special Thank You” section on the right hand side.<br>
First name.<br>
Last initial.<br>
For each person that referred business to us in the last month.<br><br>
 
I thought they wanted jokes.<br>
They wanted their name in the spotlight.<br><br>
 
The design didn’t work.<br>
The execution worked.<br>
I showed up each month.<br><br>
 
Take action.<br>
Adjust as necessary.<br><br>

Not because of what I’m doing with The Daily Musings.<br>
Not because of why I’m doing it.<br>
Because of how I’m doing it.<br><br>
 
Writing on a Microsoft Word document.<br>
Uploading the passage into Mailchimp each morning.<br>
Editing each night.<br><br>
 
No social media advertising.<br>
Barely a website.<br>
No swag.<br><br>
 
It’s painful for them to listen to.<br>
The Daily Musings could be a lot better.<br><br>

They offer advice.<br>
Their tips are good.<br>
I write them down.<br><br>
 
Then I go back home.<br>
Do some research on their idea.<br>
Agree with them.<br>
Sit back in my chair.<br>
And write another Musing.<br><br>
 
The point of The Daily Musings is to write each day.<br>
To keep a conversation going.<br><br>
 
The point isn't to reduce time.<br>
Friction.<br>
To make the process easier.<br><br>

I'll do that somewhere else.<br><br>

I still have the business plan I wrote in August 2009.<br><br>
 
The business plan I presented to the bank.<br>
The business plan that the bank accepted.<br><br>
 
The opening page included the following line:<br><br>
 
“The wide-ranging breadth of products offered will serve as a significant competitive advantage against local insurance agencies and financial planners.”<br><br>
 
On the day we opened…<br>
We only had one product to sell (Commerce Insurance).<br>
We didn’t sell financial planning.<br>
I was unsure is I used the word “breadth” correctly.<br><br>
 
We were asking for a $75,000 loan.<br>
The loan was for operational costs.<br>
We promised to pay the loan back in 60 months.<br><br>
 
We wrote a marketing plan in the proposal.<br>
It included little league baseball coaching (we never did).<br>
It included youth basketball sponsorships (we never did).<br>
The Elks and The Masons Memberships (we never did).<br><br>
 
We discussed new websites called Facebook and LinkedIn.<br>
We thought the websites would help us attract new clients.<br><br>
 
There were 70 independent insurance agencies located within five miles of us.<br>
We were 25 years old.<br>
Our business plan was accepted for $75,000.<br>
The fee to open the loan was $10.<br><br>
 
We never took a dime from the loan.<br>
It sat in an account and was closed two years later for lack of use.<br>
The bank didn’t give me the $10 back.<br><br>
 
They claimed it as a service fee.<br>
That $10 was some of the best money I ever spent.<br><br>
 
I have a comic book in my closet that I used to call a Business Plan.<br>
Thank goodness we didn’t follow the plan closely.<br>
Except for the Facebook and LinkedIn websites.<br><br>
 
We were on the right side of that guess.<br>

			  We bought Emma a microphone for her 5th birthday.<br><br>
 
It’s a Bluetooth microphone.<br>
Bright pink.<br>
And very loud.<br><br>
 
She’s been singing all day on the microphone.<br>
In her room.<br>

In the hallways.<br>
In the kitchen.<br>
In the living room.<br><br>
 
She sings wherever she wants to sing.<br><br>

It’s impossible to focus with her wailing away on the microphone.<br><br>
 
I got up to tell her to stop.<br>
Then I listened to her:<br><br>
 
“I looooooove my microphone….<br>
I looooooove my room.<br>
I looooooove my bed.”<br><br>
 
She’s having the time of her life.<br>
And letting everyone know.<br><br>
 
I won’t stop her.<br>
Hopefully she never stops.<br>

			  Each semester, I teach a few classes at The University of Connecticut.<br><br>
 
Sometimes I’m a guest speaker for part of the class.<br>
Today, I’m the “Professor” for the day.<br><br>
 
The class is in the Business Department.<br>
It is called: The Entrepreneurial Journey<br>
The class is to help students assess whether entrepreneurship is for them.<br><br>
 
Many of the students have already tried to start their company.<br>
Literally, many.<br>
When I was in school, I knew two or three people that tried.<br>
It wasn’t cool to be an entrepreneur.<br><br>
 
I’ll be running the class by myself with a few TAs in the audience.<br>
There will be around 200 students in the audience as well.<br><br>
 
Years ago, I’d have notecards.<br>
I’d practice the speech with KG.<br>
I’d lose a little sleep the night before.<br><br>
 
Today, I’m listening to Grateful Dead and thinking about when I was in college.<br>
I’m going to enjoy the ride down.<br>
Walk the campus.<br>
Have a cup of coffee.<br>
And smile during the entire class.<br><br>
 
The speech doesn’t matter.<br>
Being asked to speak is the win.<br>

Agreement is what we desire.<br><br>
 
It’s also a path to average.<br>
To failure.<br><br>
 
I get a little nervous with complete agreement.<br><br>
 
Why is there no opposition?<br>
Do people not care?<br>
Is the problem not a problem?<br>
What am I not seeing?<br><br>
 
I’ve tried to start two companies with complete agreement.<br>
Both are no longer in existence.<br><br>
 
I expect a counter-opinion with an idea.<br><br>
 
That’s what I desire.<br><br>
 
To make the idea better.<br>
Stronger.<br>
Or to kill the idea.<br><br>
 
Consensus is a silent killer.<br>
No one truly cares.<br>
“It’s a cute idea.<br>
Go run with it.”<br><br>
 
I’m looking for disagreement.<br>
Someone that cares enough to want it to be better.<br>
Or to not exist entirely.<br><br>
 
That means I’m onto something.<br>

She’s five.<br><br>
 
Things come natural to Emma.<br><br>
 
She’s not overly athletic.<br>
She’s not too tall (don’t act surprised).<br>
Not the loudest.<br>
Not the talkative one in the group.<br>
Not the smartest.<br><br>
 
But, she’s a leader.<br>
Her friends flock to her.<br><br>
 
Mason comes up with 90 ideas.<br>
But he chooses what she wants to do.<br><br>
 
She doesn’t tell the best jokes.<br>
But her laugh makes you laugh.<br><br>
 
Every story involves a butt.<br>
She’s always brushing her hair.<br>
Or putting on makeup.<br>
Or spraying KG’s perfume.<br>
Or singing.<br><br>
 
In a way, her middle name guides her life.<br>
Her middle name is Buzzy.<br>
An ode to her great grandmother, Mildred.<br>
Everyone called her Buzzy.<br><br>
 
Emma buzzes around our house.<br>
She’s a whirlwind of crazy and fun.<br>
She’s always laughing about something.<br>
She drives our puppy crazy.<br>
Yet, the dog follows her around the house.<br><br>
 
Today, we’re flying to Disney World on Emma’s 5th birthday.<br>
Because that’s a crazy thing to do too.<br>
Wish us luck.<br>
We’ll be buzzing around Florida with our five and six year olds.<br><br>
 
Happy Birthday to Emma Buzzy.<br>

I start new habits all the time.<br><br>
 
I’m a tinkerer at heart.<br>
I will try almost anything as long as it aligns with my long-term goals.<br><br>
 
For instance:<br>
Fasting is unlikely to be something I try.<br>
It doesn’t align with goals that are in my horizon.<br>
It doesn’t solve a problem.<br><br>
 
My diet is something I’ll experiment with, forever.<br>
I haven’t found a perfect solve.<br>
I’m open to new ideas.<br>
I’m willing to try anything that could prevent cancer and help me feel good.<br><br>
 
When I start something new, I try to be strict with myself.<br>
I try to make a streak.<br>
To maintain focus.<br><br>
 
I used to ask others to help me.<br>
Create an accountability group.<br>
Shift from self-discipline to group discipline.<br><br>
 
Instead of being tough of myself, I asked others to help me.<br><br>
 
Almost all of my habits in group settings fell short.<br>
I rarely made it to the finish line.<br>
The groups I started fizzled out.<br><br>
 
Then I’d question if I was on the wrong path.<br>
If it wasn’t important to them, why is it important to me?<br><br>
 
Working in private doesn’t require motivation.<br>
It forces you to consider difficult questions:<br>
Is this worth it?<br>
Is this essential?<br>
Is this needed?<br><br>
 
If it is, why do I need a group?<br>
The answer is I don’t.<br>
I only need a group for comfort.<br><br>
 
Self-discipline isn’t meant to be comfortable.<br><br>
It’s a challenge.

KG asked me what Enneagram type I thought she was.<br><br>
 
I said “2” almost before she was done asking the question.<br>
She laughed as hard as I’ve seen her laugh before.<br>
She knew what I knew.<br><br>
 
KG is an Enneagram 2.<br><br>
 
The Helper.<br><br>
 
She’s empathetic.<br>
Friendly.<br>
Self-Sacrificial.<br>
She’s a people-pleaser.<br><br>
 
I’m an Enneagram 8.<br><br>
 
The Challenger.<br><br>
 
I’m assertive.<br>
Resourceful.<br>
Decisive.<br>
Self-confident.<br><br>
 
We looked up how they match together.<br><br>
 
Twos and Eights match up well…<br>
In some ways.<br>
They are more alike than it appears.<br>
Both want to have their impact on their personal environment.<br>
Both are sentimental and have deep feelings.<br><br>
 
Here’s a brief summary we enjoyed reading:<br>
Both see each other's noble qualities and can be each other's staunchest supporters and admirers. Their roles are also clearly delineated, so they do not get in each other's way.<br><br>
 
We smiled.<br>
It’s true.<br>
But, there’s more.<br><br>
 
Both types tend to move in opposite directions and have increasingly opposing views about how to treat other people. Eights become more hard-hearted and confrontational, while Twos become more possessive and self-sacrificial. Between themselves, they can get into battles with each other about whose philosophy will prevail..<br><br>
 
I read the sentence and gave a nervous laugh.<br>
“Not us, right??”<br><br>
 
KG just smiled.<br>
It is us.<br>
We do get into battles on this subject and others.<br><br>
 
Eights cause Twos the most stress, according to the Enneagram study.<br><br>
 
No pressure, no diamonds.<br>
Here’s to a lifetime of creating stress, KG!<br>

I’ve wasted a lot of time on outfits for Emma and Mason.<br><br>
 
There’s a pattern to my waste.<br>
I see something I want them to wear.<br>
Something that fits right.<br>
Something with a brand name.<br>
Something that will look good in pictures.<br><br>
 
I buy the outfit.<br>
I purchase the jewelry for Emma.<br>
I get Mason the hat.<br><br>
 
I make a big deal of it.<br>
Get them super excited.<br>
Then I hear the inevitable comment:<br><br>
 
“I’ll wear it tomorrow!”<br>
That’s the death of the outfit.<br>
Tomorrow won’t come.<br>
Today is the only chance.<br><br>
 
They have no skin in the game.<br><br>
 
Now, they pick out the outfit they want to buy.<br><br>
 
Sometimes it’s a little goofy.<br>
Sometimes it’s a little too expensive.<br>
Sometimes it’s the wrong color.<br><br>
 
It’s always worn today.<br><br>

I watch plane crashes on YouTube.<br><br>
 
I’ve watched the 9/11 crashes dozens of times.<br>
I’ve watched breakdowns of why plans crash.<br>
Such as the Payne Stewart tragedy.<br>
Lynard Skynard.<br>
Countless videos.<br><br>
 
I’m terrified of flying.<br><br>

Yet, in 2018 and 2019 I flew almost once a week until COVID hit in 2020.<br>
I’m on an airplane now as I write this Musing.<br>
We’re 963 miles away from Orlando.<br>
36,002 feet in the air.<br>
Traveling 517 miles per hour.<br>
Near New York City.<br><br>
 
I’m not scared of driving.<br>
I don’t watch car crashes.<br><br>

I’m not scared of walking across the street.<br>
I don’t watch pedestrians getting hit by cars.<br><br>

I don’t have anxiety to feed.<br><br>
 
I’m sabotaging myself.<br>
I’m increasing my own fear with each video on plane crashes.<br><br>

I'm full of anxiety when I fly.<br>
And I can’t stop eating up the videos.<br>

Succeeding at being a Dad is similar to being happy.<br><br>
 
One of my favorite quotes from Lou Holtz is:<br>
“Happiness is nothing more than having a poor memory.”<br><br>
 
The worst nights with Emma and Mason can lead to the best mornings.<br>
If I have a poor memory.<br><br>
 
Emma can drive us nuts at night.<br>
She’s hungry as we’re walking up the stairs to her room.<br><br>

She doesn’t need to go potty before bed.<br>
Even though she just drank a gallon of water.<br><br>

We need to leave her light on.<br>
Her fan on full-blast.<br><br>
 
These are just a few examples.<br><br>
 
We get her into bed.<br>
Then part two begins.<br><br>
 
If you’re a parent, I don’t need to continue.<br>
If you don’t have kids, just imagine a bad horror movie.<br>
You watch the character walk alone in the basement.<br>
Without a flashlight.<br>
With headphones on blasting their favorite music.<br>
With their back to the killer.<br>
And you just laugh.<br>
“What a mess…”<br><br>
 
It’s like getting your kids to bed.<br>
You just laugh when they won’t go to bed sometimes.<br>
“What a mess…”<br><br>
 
Then the morning comes.<br><br>
 
If I have a great memory, I great them with a frown.<br>
“Thanks for last night…”<br><br>
 
With a poor memory, I give them a hug.<br>
“How’d you sleep sunshine?”<br><br>
 
Happiness is nothing more than a poor memory.<br>
Being a successful Dad is nothing more than a poor memory.<br>

My sales career blossomed when I learned a simple truth.<br><br>
 
To be better at sales you need to move forward from each no with belief.<br>
With confidence.<br>
With enthusiasm.<br><br>
 
Each set-back is a chance to learn from your target market.<br>
Each set-back is a chance to learn more about how your process works.<br>
Each set-back is a chance to be better.<br><br>
 
I didn’t learn from the moments that involved a yes.<br>
I made assumptions why it happened.<br><br>
 
My presentation.<br>
The timing.<br>
The market.<br><br>
 
I couldn’t achieve clarity from a yes.<br><br>
 
When I heard a no, I got to ask my target customer questions.<br>
I got to uncover what went wrong.<br>
I got to work on something.<br>
To better part of myself.<br>
Or my product.<br>
I got the opportunity to innovate.<br>
To try again.<br><br>
 
Moving from no to no with enthusiasm helped me find success.<br>

Thank you.<br><br>
 
I hope you hear that a lot today.<br>
Let me start and tell you why you matter to me.<br><br>
 
A year ago I was in a pretty dark place.<br><br>
 
I was happy and filled with grief at the same time.<br>
A feeling I had never felt before.<br><br>
 
Today, I’m not.<br>
I feel comfortable in my own skin.<br><br>
 
I’ll keep this short and sweet…<br>
It’s because of you.<br><br>
 
Community helped me heal faster than time ever could.<br><br>

Let’s dive deeper into the Musing 356.<br><br>
 
Here’s an example:<br><br>
 
I met with a CEO of a Fortune 500 Company.<br>
Let’s call him Bill.<br>
He had the perfect portfolio for us to insure at G&N.<br><br>
 
Properties in New York.<br>
New Hampshire.<br>
Massachusetts.<br><br>
 
None of them valued under 5M.<br>
A dream case.<br>
Referred by a Realtor we’ve known for years.<br>
It felt like a layup.<br><br>
 
I offered to meet him in person at his company.<br>
To review the plans.<br>
But really…<br><br>

I wanted to pitch our services to his entire company.<br>
For all of the employees.<br>
I wanted a designated spot at their lunch room.<br>
I got a little greedy.<br>
I went for the bigger sale.<br><br>

Instead of focusing on Bill, I went after the hundreds of employees.<br><br>
 
He kept rescheduling  the meeting.<br>
Excuse after excuse.<br><br>
 
Then he closed on his property without our services.<br><br>
 
I called him a few weeks after the close and asked him two simple questions:<br><br>
 
“How did I lose your business?<br>
”What do I need to do so I don’t lose the next Bill that is referred to us?”<br><br>
 
His answer was to-the-point:<br><br>
 
“Treat me like an average Joe and let me purchase via the phone or online.<br>
You don’t need to meet me in person.<br>
I knew what you were doing.”<br><br>
 
We exchanged pleasantries and then he hung up.<br><br>
 
He became a client two years later.<br>
He’s still a client.<br>
I haven’t lost a “Bill” since.<br><br>
 
Call your customers.<br>
Take their feedback.<br>
Improve your product or service.<br>

We tried to let the kids pick their own toys at Disney.<br><br>
 
Going to Disney is expensive.<br>
We didn’t want to try to save money on the toys.<br>
That’s part of the experience.<br><br>
 
Necklaces for Emma.<br>
Shirts for Mason.<br>
Custom-made light sabers for both of them,<br><br>

Whatever they wanted.<br><br>
 
Magic Kingdom is where I almost broke the rule.<br><br>
 
We were late for lunch.<br>
Mason and Emma handed me the things they wanted.<br>
Then KG and the kids went to go check in for lunch while I paid.<br><br>
 
Two notebooks and two pens.<br>
But.. the notebooks were different.<br>
Mason wanted a Star Wars notebook.<br>
Emma wanted a Minnie Mouse notebook with sequins all over it.<br><br>
 
I got to the cashier and she smiled.<br>
“These don’t have prices on them son.<br>
Let me go check!”<br><br>
 
She came back and said the phrase you don’t want to hear:<br><br>
 
“Wow, these are really, really nice.”<br>
That means: "these are expensive"<br><br>
 
The notebooks and pens came to almost $80.<br>
They have endless amounts of notebooks and pens.<br>
I felt my face turn red.<br>
Then I remembered our plan...<br><br>

They want it, they get it.<br><br>
 
The notebooks and pens turned out to be a vacation-saver during all of our meals.<br>
They never left their side.<br>
Four days later… every page has a drawing.<br>
A doodle.<br>
A story.<br>
A game.<br><br>
 
They loved the notebooks and pens.<br>
We loved the quiet time during meals.<br><br>
 
Life has a funny way of reminding you about the deals you make with yourself.<br>

I sensed my Dad’s presence after his death.<br><br>
 
It felt like birds were following me on the golf course.<br>
Grasshoppers would show up at the strangest time.<br>
Our kids would mention him at random moments.<br><br>
 
Little reminders as I wandered around.<br>
I hoped he was watching my steps.<br>
Smiling down.<br><br>
 
At first it was strange.<br>
Then it felt comforting.<br>
KG and I would smile.<br>
We both knew what the other person was going to say.<br>
“There’s Steve…”<br><br>
 
Now, I don’t feel his presence.<br>
Maybe that’s a sign he’s moved on.<br>
Maybe he knows I’m going to be OK.<br><br>
 
Death taught me that my beliefs can change.<br>

We bought our first house in 2013.<br><br>
 
We closed on July 31st.<br>
On July 31st I emailed KG.<br>
The email had a link and three words:<br>
“Likely this grill.”<br><br>
 
The first purchase I made was a Weber Grill.<br><br>
 
I was so proud of the grill.<br>
It was a sign of homeownership.<br><br>
 
I imagined a grill full of meat and a patio full of friends.<br><br>
 
Fast forward to 2021…<br>
We try to eat plant based at home.<br>
I haven’t used our grill in about two years.<br><br>
 
Grilled veggies are incredible.<br>
I order them when I’m at a restaurant.<br>
At home… I rarely think about going outside to grill.<br><br>
 
I don’t regret purchasing the grill in 2013.<br>
It was the right investment at the time.<br><br>
 
We are terrible predictors of the future.<br>
 
“I’ll never…”<br>
“I will always…”<br>
These phrases are a waste of time.<br><br>
 
Purchase things that matter in the moment.<br>
Don’t make predictions of their value down the road.<br><br>

PS: If you want an 8-year-old Weber grill, let me know :)

Influencers have their own agenda.<br><br>
 
We all do.<br><br>
 
We think we know their goals.<br>
We think we know everyone’s goals.<br><br>
 
We are rarely correct.<br><br>
 
I started dabbling into crypto.<br>
Because I dabble into just about anything.<br><br>
 
I’m the type of guy that’ll buy a website domain.<br>
Start an LLC.<br>
And write up a marketing plan.<br>
Based on a conversation with friends over dinner.<br><br>
 
I’ve done it before.<br>
Multiple times.<br>
My GoDaddy account had 17 domains at one point.<br><br>
 
Restaurants.<br>
Marketing companies.<br>
Plumbing.<br><br>
 
Point is… I’m hard-wired to be into cryptocurrency.<br><br>
 
Even after writing about influencers.<br>
Studying them.<br>
And at one point, being one.<br><br>
 
I fell for the trick of influencers.<br><br>

I believed I knew their purpose.<br>
Their mission.<br><br>
 
I bought into an influencer’s crypto idea.<br>
It cost me $150.<br>
I think it is worth $0 at the time I am writing this Musing.<br><br>
 
It was the most valuable $150 I've spent in a while.<br><br>
 
The $150 reminded me what it’s like to lose.<br>
The $150 reminded me to do my own research.<br><br>
 
If I do anything positive in the crypto community, it will be because of the $150.<br><br>
 
I’d rather lose quickly than lose in the long-term.<br><br>
 
The influencer got me this time.<br>
I’ll be the winner in the long-term.<br>

My relationship with coffee changed during COVID.<br><br>
 
I treated coffee like a yes-man.<br>
If coffee was near me, the answer was yes.<br><br>
 
I rarely turned down a cup.<br>
Morning, afternoon, or night.<br><br>
 
Espresso was my secret weapon.<br>
I’d have one or two a day.<br><br>
 
When you’re in business development, espresso is your best friend.<br><br>
 
When COVID hit, I had to make coffee each time I wanted a cup.<br>
It became clear how much I was drinking.<br><br>
 
We drink pour-over coffee at home.<br>
Each cup of coffee takes about 11 minutes to make.<br><br>
 
I drank about four cups of coffee a day.<br>
That meant I made coffee for 44 minutes a day.<br>
Drank the coffee for another hour-ish.<br><br>
 
That’s about two hours devoted to just coffee.<br>
Almost 13% of the time I’m awake.<br><br>
 
Too much.<br>
It was time to cut back.<br><br>
 
I drink one cup of coffee per day now.<br>
Sometimes KG and I share a second cup on the weekend.<br><br>
 
That’s a major difference.<br><br>
 
I don’t seek coffee.<br>
I enjoy it.<br>
Coffee held a power over me before COVID.<br><br>
 
Now it’s just another thing.<br>

Tomorrow will be a full year.<br><br>

365 days of writing.<br>
365 days of editing.<br>
365 days of shipping.<br><br>

Most of what I wrote is a reminder to myself.<br>
To continue to have difficult conversations.<br>
To continue to get better each day.<br><br>

Small steps.<br>
Day by day.<br><br>

The steps turned into miles.<br><br>

I started writing years ago.<br>
In journals.<br>
In Microsoft Word documents.<br><br>

Then I read books about developing a writing habit.<br><br>

I wrote more.<br><br>

I took a writing class.<br><br>

I wrote more.<br><br>

Then I had a setback.<br>
A death that rocked my world.<br><br>

That's when I decided to share my writing.<br><br>

I practiced for years in private before I practiced in public.<br><br>

I learned more in the 365 days I practiced in public than the years I practiced in private.<br><br>

Share your talents.<br>
You will serve others.<br><br>

Cheers,<br>

Today is the last Daily Musing.<br><br>

I told myself I'd ship my writing for 365 days.<br>
I made a promise.<br>
With no intended ROI.<br>
No growth goals.<br>
No subscriber metrics.<br><br>

No scoreboard.<br><br>

That makes it easier to exit.<br><br>

The last 365 days was meant to honor my Dad.<br>
Not just the person he was.<br>
The relationship he fostered with me.<br><br>

I think I've accomplished that goal.<br>
The Daily Musings project is complete.<br>
It has served thousands more people than I thought possible.<br><br>

I'll leave you with my Dad's last words.<br><br>

The Last Words<br><br>

I was with my Dad a few hours before he died.<br>
It was around 10pm.<br>
He hadn’t moved in hours.<br>
No signs of life other than his death rattle.<br><br>

I lied in his bed.<br>
Took a deep breath.<br>
And I began speaking.<br><br>

I made sure he knew the impact he had on my life.<br>
On KG’s life.<br>
On Mason and Emma's life.<br>
On Kenzie’s life.<br><br>
 
I said a few more words and then I got up.<br>
I knelt by his side and told him I was going to keep his wish.<br><br>

I told him I was going home to my family.<br>
Where he told me I always belonged.<br>
I was going to be with them.<br><br>

My support for him was finished.<br>
My support for them continues.<br><br>
 
He jumped up and tried to get out of the bed.<br>
The nurse turned white as a ghost.<br>
We held him back.<br>
He waved his hands frantically.<br><br>
 
Then he grabbed my neck.<br>
Hard.<br>
His piercing eyes inches from mine.<br><br>

He yelled:<br>
“You’re a great son, young grasshopper.”<br><br>

That’s the last thing he ever said.<br><br>

So, what’s next, ZG?<br>
I’m about to find out.<br>
There's a beauty in uncertainty.<br><br>

Thanks for being part of the journey.<br>

Happy Pizza Friday,<br>
